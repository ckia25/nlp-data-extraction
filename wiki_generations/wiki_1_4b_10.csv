The beach surrounding the bay is mostly sandy. A secluded strip of shore under the steep cliff on the northern side of the bay is a popular nudist beach, although the practice is technically illegal in Malta and frowned upon by the conservative Catholic population.

Ġnejna is notable for its striking clay slopes and limestone cliffs.  These serve as the headlands for one of Malta's few remaining perennial freshwater springs, that runs through Wied il-Ġnejna.  Although the valley is a protected area, its watercourse is considered at risk due to illegal damming and tapping.

On 30 June 2007, a boat with 26 illegal immigrants was intercepted at Ġnejna Bay by Maltese authorities.

Fishing
The fishermen of Ġnejna Bay use traditional techniques, such as attracting fish with lamps at night.

Fortifications
Above the bay, on a tall, rocky outcrop, is Lippia Tower (also known as Ta’ Lippia or Ġnejna Watch Tower), built in 1637 by Vincenzo Maculani upon orders from Grand Master Giovanni Paolo Lascaris.   Lippia Tower formed part of the intricate coastal defence network constructed by the Knights of St. John.  Watchguards housed in Lippia Tower and a nearby tower at Għajn Tuffieħa, would communicate with the inland Nadur Tower by means of flags by day and bonfires by night, which would, in turn, raise the alarm in the walled city of Mdina when corsairs were sighted off the western coast of Malta.

Ġnejna has a pillbox dating from the Second World War, camouflaged to look like a farmhouse.

The Legend of Castello Zammitello

The road leading down towards Ġnejna Bay features Castello Zamittello, a fortified house built in 1675 in a Norman style.  According to local legend, Lucia, the only daughter of a certain Baron Bernardo Zammit, disappeared from her bedroom on the morning of her wedding to a wealthy Sicilian count, some 300 years ago.

Biography

Early life and education

Joseph Xavier was born in the village of Saint-Denis, in the commune of Saint-Denis, in the commune of Saint-Denis, in the commune of Saint-Denis, in the commune of Saint-Denis, in the commune of","Louis Joseph Xavier, Duke of Burgundy (13 September 1751 – 22 March 1761), was a French prince of the House of Bourbon and heir apparent of the throne of France. Although he was the first live-birth son, he died of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis at the young age of 9.

Early life

Louis Joseph Xavier was born at the Palace of Versailles. He was the third surviving child and eldest son of Louis, Dauphin of France and Maria Josepha of Saxony, and was thus the oldest brother to the future kings Louis XVI, Louis XVIII and Charles X. It is a known fact that he was the favorite child of his parents, and was said to be handsome and bright.

He was put in the care of Marie Isabelle de Rohan and given the title of Duke of Burgundy by his grandfather, King Louis XV. He was much loved by those who were close to him, especially his older sister Marie Zéphyrine, who died at the age of five in 1755. It is unknown if the Duke, who was not even four years old yet, was affected by this.  But it is known, however, that the absence of his older sister was felt by the Duke.

Death

The young Duke was pushed off a wooden horse by one of his playmates in 1759. As he was recognized for his kindness, he did not tell anyone about this, in order to prevent his friend from getting into any trouble. After this incident, the Duke of Burgundy's health started to deteriorate quickly. The family's physician, Dr. Barbier, decided to operate on him in 1760. The Duke was operated on while he was conscious. Knowing that he would die, the Dauphin had him baptised on 29 November 1760, with Louis XV and Marie Leszczyńska, his grandparents, as his godparents. Until that moment, he had been known just as ""Burgundy"". By 1761, the Duke was bound to his bed, unable to move his legs, with what was diagnosed as extra pulmonary tuberculosis of the bone. He would later die from this disease, on 22 March 1761.

The country provides 20% of Africa's cashew nut and only trails in production of Nigeria, Cote D'Ivoire ,and Guinea-Bissau, according to figures released in 2012 by United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO). The country has been engaged in the production of the cash crop since before independence in the years 1960s however, poor regulation and lack of reliable payments to farmers have posed significant challenges to the Cashew Nut farming industry in Tanzania. Guinea-Bissau, a country a tenth of the area of Tanzania's, has a significantly greater yield.

The cash crop is usually cultivated in the southern coastal regions of the country, near the towns of Mtwara, Kilwa and Dar es Salaam. The sale and marketing of the product is run by the Cashewnut Board of Tanzania, through various farmer co-operatives. More than ninety percent of the exports are destined for India and almost entirely in raw form. The lack of domestic processing firms costs the country vital foreign revenues and thousands of jobs. The Tanzanian government has been facing challenges for finding potential investors in order to revive the cashew processing industry in Tanzania.

History

Cashew nuts have been grown on a commercial scale in the country since the 1950s. Due to developing infrastructure and lack of jobs in the southern region, cashew cultivation was highly favored. The zone was also previously used as part of the failed Tanganyika Groundnut scheme. The industry's production peaked in 1973, when the total output exceeded to a record breaking 145,000 tonnes.

The industry almost collapsed in the 1980s. Annual production had dropped as low as 20,000 tonnes in 1986. This was largely due to various government ",1,As one of the largest Cashewnut producers in,As one of the largest Cashewnut producers in,10,1.4b

It is worth comparing this species with the similar species Trivia arctica, the northern cowrie.

Shell description

The shell of this species is glossy, convolute and lemon-shaped, with 20-30 transverse ridges. The dorsal part of the shell is a pinkish or reddish-brown with three characteristic darker spots in mature individuals, on spot anterior, the other posterior and one in the centre, all situated along a central line. Juvenile shells are all white or light-coloured.  The apertural side is white and flattened. The aperture is narrow and runs along the whole length of the shell. At the ends it turns to the left in the direction of the swollen body whorl. The transverse ridges are strong and often bifurcate. The ones at the ends are almost U-shaped.

The shell length is up to a maximum of about 15 mm and its width about 8 mm.

The dark mantle is covered by few papillae, usually tipped with pale yellow. The mantle is drawn out into a long siphon anteriorly, extending over the whole (or almost the whole) shell. The foot is orange or bright yellow.

The breeding season is late spring or summer. The larvae have a very dark stomach and intestine. More developed larvae in the veliger stage have a two-lobed velum (a structure used for swimming and particulate food collection) that is slightly indented at sides. The larvae reach the adult form in about five to six months.

Distribution
This species occurs from the Mediterranean Sea to the Shetland archipelago in the north of Scotland, but is more common in the south.

In Orkney and some parts of Scotland, the species are known as 'groatie buckies'.

They were the last broadside armored frigates to be built for the Austrian Empire, and the last vessels completed to see action against the Italians at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. Intended to have been armed with new breech-loading Krupp guns, the outbreak of the Seven Weeks' War prevented the delivery of the guns, forcing the Austrian Navy to arm the ships with a battery of sixteen older 48-pounder muzzle-loading guns.

Hastily finished after the war started, both ships saw action at the Battle of Lissa in July. There, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff; in the course of the melee, the ship rammed and sank the Italian ironclad , which proved to be the decisive action in the battle. After the war, both ships were laid up and did not see much significant activity for the remainder of their careers owing to reduced naval funding in what had become the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Design

He was","John George Graves (1866–1945) was a successful English entrepreneur and public benefactor. He became Sheffield's Lord Mayor and an Alderman in 1926 and he was given Freedom of the City in 1929. He was born in Lincolnshire in 1866 and died in 1945, after having settled in Sheffield.

Graves moved to Sheffield to become an apprentice watchmaker. He set up one of Britain's first mail order businesses, selling first watches and then a wide range of goods. The company employed, at its peak, 3,000 people in Sheffield and had an annual turnover of £1m. The company was absorbed by Great Universal Stores after Graves' death.

A keen art collector, Graves donated nearly £60,000 towards the development of art galleries in Sheffield, including Sheffield Central Library, the Graves Art Gallery and the Mappin Art Gallery. He also contributed hundreds of pictures from his private collection. Between 1902 and his death in 1945, Graves lived at Riverdale House in the Ranmoor area of Sheffield.  

Graves donated over £1 million to Sheffield, including the establishment of Sheffield University's Student Union.  Part of the Union building is known as the ""Graves Building"". He also made gifts of land to the city, including Graves Park, Ecclesall Woods, Tinsley playing fields, Concord Park and Blacka Moor. The J. G. Graves Trust, a charitable trust set up in his name, exists to the present day.

The U.S. Open was the first of the last U.S. Open to the U.S.,"The 1926 U.S. Open was the 30th U.S. Open, held July 8–10 at Scioto Country Club in Columbus, Ohio. Noted amateur Bobby Jones, winner of the British Open two weeks earlier, won the second of his four U.S. Opens, one stroke ahead of runner-up Joe Turnesa.

After rounds of 70-79-71, Jones was three strokes behind third round leader Turnesa, who unraveled on the last nine on Saturday afternoon, with five bogeys in six holes. He managed to birdie the final hole for a 77 and 294 total for solo second (and the winner's share of the purse). Jones got off to a slow start, with bogeys at three of his first five holes, then birdied the 7th and ran off a streak of nine consecutive fours. Needing a par on the par-5 18th to tie (and force a playoff round), Jones hit a  tee shot, then followed with an approach to the green, leaving  for eagle. Two-putting for birdie, Jones carded a one-over 73 to best Turnesa by a stroke. Bill Mehlhorn opened with 68 on Thursday,  and led after both of the first two rounds, but was ten over par on Saturday and was four strokes back, in a four-way tie for third. 

Jones became the first player to win the U.S. Open and British Open in the same year, and he won both again four years later in 1930, during his grand slam year. Later double Open winners were Gene Sarazen (1932), Ben Hogan (1953), Lee Trevino (1971), Tom Watson (1982), and Tiger Woods (2000). While Turnesa never won a major, he did finish second twice and his brother Jim won the PGA Championship in 1952. Another brother, Willie, won the U.S. Amateur twice and the British Amateur once. In total, eight Turnesa brothers played on the PGA Tour.

This was also the first year since 1919 that the tournament was extended to three days, because of the number of entries and the size of the gallery. The first two rounds were now played over two days, Thursday and Friday, with a 36-hole cut. The final two rounds continued to be played on one day, Saturday.

The Sydenham district for census purposes is bounded by Lake Ontario to the south and east, by Princess Street to the north and Barrie Street to the west. These boundaries do not coincide with the Sydenham Ward boundaries for city councillor elections as they include parts of the downtown main street.

The average family income for the area is $85,636  which is considerably higher than the city average. This is attributable to the neighbourhoods proximity to Queen's University. The Sydenham neighbourhood has a mix of business and retail uses on its east and north sides as it approaches Princess Street, which is Kingston's primary downtown business district. The majority of the neighbourhood however is a mix of permanent homes and rental accommodations for students. Many of Kingston's historic limestone structures can be found in the Sydenham neighbourhood.

The neighbourhood is home to Empire Life Financial's Canadian Headquarters at King & Johnson Streets and is one of Kingston's largest employers with 550 full-time employees.

The common brown lemur is a,"The common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus) is a species of lemur in the family Lemuridae. It is found in Madagascar and Mayotte.

Range
The common brown lemur lives in western Madagascar north of the Betsiboka River and eastern Madagascar between the Mangoro River and Tsaratanana, as well as in inland Madagascar connecting the eastern and western ranges. They also live on the island of Mayotte, although this population is believed to have been introduced there by man.

Physical description
The common brown lemur has a total length of , including  of tail. Weight ranges from . The short, dense fur is primarily brown or grey-brown. The face, muzzle and crown are dark grey or black with paler eyebrow patches, and the eyes are orange-red.

Similar lemur species within their range include the mongoose lemur, E. mongoz, in the west and the red-bellied lemur, E. rubriventer, in the east. They can be distinguished from these species by the fact that E. mongoz is more of a grey color and E. rubriventer is more reddish. There is also some overlap with the black lemur in northeast Madagascar in the Galoko, Manongarivo and Tsaratanana Massifs. There is also overlap and hybridization with the white-fronted brown lemur, E. albifrons, in the northeast portion of the common brown lemur's range.

Diet
The common brown lemur's diet consists primarily of fruits, young leaves, and flowers. In some locations it eats invertebrates, such as cicadas, spiders and millipedes. It also eats bark, sap, soil and red clay (see geophagy). It can tolerate greater levels of toxic compounds from plants than other lemurs can.

Behavior
Consistent with its large range, the common brown lemur occupies a variety of forest types, including lowland rainforests, montane rainforests, moist evergreen forests and dry deciduous forests. They spend about 95% of their time in upper layers of the forest and less than 2% of their time on the ground.

The building is three stories, with a basement; the central entrance faces 25th Street.

History
Before the courthouse was built, the Appellate Division, First Department, of New York State Supreme Court had occupied rented quarters on Fifth Avenue and 19th Street. Plans for the new building were first filed in 1896. The building plans were jointly approved in June 1896 by the city sinking fund commissioners and the Appellate Division justices.

The Appellate Division, First Department formally took possession of the new courthouse on January 2, 1900. The budget for the building was $700,000, but only $633,768 was spent.

Exterior
The marble Beaux-Arts courthouse, in the style of an 18th-century English country house, was designed by James Brown Lord and built in 1896−1899. It is considered to be an ""outstanding"" example of the City Beautiful movement. Some 25 percent of the cost was spent on sculpture, a huge sum at the time. At the time of its construction, the American Architect and Building News predicted that ""the rest of the country will envy New York the possession of this building."" In 1900, Charles DeKay wrote in The Independent that the courthouse ""shines like an ivory casket among boxes of ordinary maple.""

The exterior features sculptures in white marble on subjects related to law.  Karl Bitter's Peace is the central grouping on the balustrade by Madison Square. Daniel Chester French's Justice is the central grouping on 25th Street. Justice is flanked by Power and Study, also by French.

One scholar has suggested that this story and Kafka's letters illustrate his distaste for the legal profession.

Members served three year terms from February 1, 2002 to February 1, 2005.

Background 
The first national election to be held after Chen Shui-bian's victory in the 2000 presidential election, the election resulted for the first time in the Kuomintang (KMT) losing its majority and President Chen's Democratic Progressive Party to emerging as the largest party in the legislature. However, the Pan-Blue Coalition developed between the Kuomintang, the People First Party and the New Party, enabled the Chinese reunificationist and conservative opposition to muster a slim majority over the pro-Taiwan independence Pan-Green Coalition formed between the Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union. This resulted in much of President Chen's agenda being derailed or deadlocked for the following three years.

Overall

Results
The KMT lost its majority for the first time, losing 46 seats and falling to 68 seats. The largest party had become the DPP with 87 seats, followed by the KMT, and the PFP with 46 seats.

","In Polish poetry, the Ukrainian school were a group of Romantic poets of the early 19th century who hailed from Ukraine, on the southeastern fringes of the Polish-inhabited lands of the time (this period followed the partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). The poets—Antoni Malczewski, Józef Bohdan Zaleski, Tomasz Padura and Seweryn Goszczyński—produced a distinct style of Polish Romanticism through the incorporation of Ukrainian life, landscapes, history, political events, and folklore into their works. They in turn influenced both Lithuanian and Ukrainian Romantic poetry, and, along with other Polish poets, constituted a link between the various literatures of the post-partition Commonwealth.

By volume of discharge, the Fly is the largest river in Oceania, the largest in the world without a single dam in its catchment, and overall the 25th-largest primary river in the world. It rises in the Victor Emanuel Range arm of the Star Mountains, and crosses the south-western lowlands before flowing into the Gulf of Papua in a large delta.

Description
The Fly flows mostly through the Western Province, though for a small stretch it forms the boundary between Papua New Guinea and the Indonesia province of Papua.  This section protrudes slightly to the west of the 141°E longitude line. To compensate for this slight gain in territory for Papua New Guinea, the border south of the Fly River is slightly east of the 141°E longitude line.  As part of this deal, Indonesia has the right to use the Fly River to its mouth for navigation.

The principal tributaries of the Fly are the Strickland and the Ok Tedi.

Close to its mouth, the flow of the Fly River encounters a tidal bore, where an incoming high tide pushes water upstream until the changing of the tide. The range of this tidal bore is still undocumented.

Delta 

The delta of the Fly River is over 100 km wide at its entrance, but only 11 km wide at the apex upstream of Kiwai Island. The delta contains 3 main distributary channels (the Southern, Northern, and Far Northern Entrances) that branch from a common point (the “apex”). The distributary channels are 5 to 15m in depth, separated by elongate, sand-mud islands that are stabilised by lush mangrove vegetation. The islands are eroded and rebuilt rapidly in the apex area, where they have lateral migration rates of up to 150 m/a, with slower rates for the more seaward islands.  Upstream from the apex the river gradually narrows to a width of 1.6 km or less.  The Fly Delta exhibits a distinctive funnel shape in plan view, attesting to the fundamental role of tidal currents in sha",1,"The Fly, at, is the second longest river in","The Fly, at, is the second longest river in",10,1.4b

Ownership
The factory is a joint venture between three companies. The Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) owns the controlling stakes of 50.5% while Kalashnikov owns 42% stake followed by 7.5% stake owned by Rosonboronexport. An Indian CEO from the Indian Army leads the company. The Army has appointed Major General Sanjeev Sengar as the Chief Executive Officer.

Background 
Since the late 1950s, the Indian armed forces had been equipped with a locally produced licensed copy of the L1A1 self-loading rifles. In mid-1980s, the decision was taken to develop a 5.56×45mm NATO calibre rifle to replace the obsolete rifles. Trials on various prototypes based on the AKM were carried out by the Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) in Pune. On the completion of the trial, The Indian Small Arms System (INSAS) was adopted in 1990. However, to phase out  the still in use bolt-action Lee–Enfield rifles as quickly as possible, India had to acquire 100,000 7.62×39mm AKM-type rifles from Russia, Hungary, Romania and Israel in 1990–92.

In April 2015, the Indian government replaced some INSAS rifles of the CRPF with AKM variants. In early 2017, it was announced that INSAS rifles were to be retired and replaced by rifles capable of firing 7.62×51mm NATO cartridges.

He was educated at the College of Arts, Cambridge, and the University of Cambridge. He","Frederick II (; 25 April 1211 – 15 June 1246), known as Frederick the Quarrelsome (Friedrich der Streitbare), was Duke of Austria and Styria from 1230 until his death. He was the fifth and last Austrian duke from the House of Babenberg, since the former margraviate was elevated to a duchy by the 1156 Privilegium Minus. He was killed in the Battle of the Leitha River, leaving no male heirs.

Family
Born in Wiener Neustadt, Frederick was the second surviving son of the Babenberg duke Leopold VI of Austria and Theodora Angelina, a Byzantine princess. The death of his elder brother Henry in 1228 made him the only heir to the Austrian and Styrian duchies.

His first wife was Byzantine princess Sophia Laskarina, probably a daughter of Theodore I Laskaris and his first wife Anna Komnene Angelina, who died in 1222. Frederick secondly married Agnes of Merania in 1229, a member of the noble House of Andechs whose dowry included large possessions in Carniola and the Windic March. From 1232 Frederick called himself Dominus Carniolae (""Lord of Carniola""), however, the couple divorced due to childlessness in 1243.

Reign
Frederick succeeded his father in 1230. Proud of his Byzantine descent, the young duke soon was known as the Quarrelsome because of his harsh rule and frequent wars against his neighbors, primarily with Hungary, Bavaria and Bohemia. Even the Austrian Kuenring ministeriales, which had so far been faithful to the ruling house, started an insurgency as soon as his reign began.

According to the Weltchronik of Jans der Enikel, Frederick had gone to the court of Emperor Frederick II by his summon, leading a procession of 200 knights wearing the triband colors of Austria. When he approached the Emperor, he was enthusiastically invited—by both command and request of Emperor Frederick—to eat bread with him. The Duke refused, stating he brought his own gold. But the Emperor insisted without prevailing. Thus instead he ordered that no one in ",0,Frederick II (; 25 April 1211 –,Frederick II (; 25 April 1211 –,10,1.4b

The two-story pink coral house was built in Honolulu, on King Street, around the 1850s by Hawaiian high chief Pākī, who initially lived there with his wife Kōnia and their hānai daughter, Lydia Pākī, the natural daughter of Keohokalole and Kapaakea. The house was called Haleākala, sometimes translated as House of the Sun (Haleakalā), but probably meant Pink House after the coral rock from which the house was constructed. Pākī built the house himself, replacing the original grass hut complex of the same name at the same site, financed by the sale of Mākaha Valley. It would later become one of the primary residences of his daughter Bernice Pauahi Bishop, and her husband, Charles Reed Bishop. Duke Kahanamoku was also born in Haleʻākala while Bishop lived there. The house was later called Aikupika (Egypt). Later still, it became the Arlington Hotel.

At the time of the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in January 1893, United States Navy Lieutenant Lucien Young commanded a detachment from the USS Boston which mustered at ""Camp Boston"", initially established at the Arlington Hotel. The building was purchased at auction in 1900 and demolished to make way for a more modern housing development.

In the mid-20th century the Apennine was divided into Proto-, Early, Middle and Late , but now archaeologists prefer to consider as ""Apennine"" only the ornamental pottery style of the later phase of Middle Bronze Age (BM3). This phase is preceded by the Grotta Nuova facies (central Italy) and by the Protoapennine B facies (southern Italy) and succeeded by the Subappennine facies of 13th-century (""Bronzo Recente""). Apennine pottery is a burnished ware incised with spirals, meanders and geometrical zones, filled with dots or transverse dashes. It has been found on Ischia island in association with LHII and LHIII pottery and on Lipari in association with LHIIIA pottery, which associations date it to the Late Bronze Age as it is defined in Greece and the Aegean.

Society

The people of the Apennine culture were alpine cattle herdsmen grazing their animals over the meadows and groves of mountainous central Italy. They lived in small hamlets located in defensible places. On the move between summer pastures they built temporary camps or lived in caves and rock shelters. Their range was not necessarily confined to the hills; their pottery has been found on the Capitoline hill at Rome as well as on the islands mentioned above.

Imputations of ethnicity
In the 19th and early 20th centuries various theorists made various imputations of ethnicity concerning the Apennine culture. In the 20th century, the Italian scholar, Massimo Pallottino, who specialized in Etruscan civilization, rejected them as oversimple. At least with reference to Italy, he discarded Kossinna's Law, which states languages and ethnic groups are to be identified with archaeological groups. Therefore, Pallottino argued that terms such as ""the Terramare culture"" or ""the Apennine culture"" have no ethnic or linguistic significance.

She was named after the 19th century Admiral Sir Edward Augustus Inglefield (1820–1894), and is so far the only warship to carry the name of that seafaring family. In May 1940, her pennant number was changed to I02.

Description
The I-class ships were improved versions of the preceding H-class. Inglefield displaced  at standard load and  at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of  and a draught of . She was powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of  and were intended to give a maximum speed of . Inglefield reached a speed of  from  during her sea trials. The ship carried enough fuel oil to give her a range of  at . Her crew numbered 175 officers and ratings.

The ship mounted five 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X' and 'Y' from bow to stern. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, Inglefield was fitted with two quadruple mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The I class was fitted with two above-water quintuple torpedo tube mounts amidships for  torpedoes. One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 16 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. The I-class ships were fitted with the ASDIC sound detection system to locate submarines underwater.

Anti-submarine Action
On the outbreak of war, Inglefield was deployed as the leader of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, Mediterranean Fleet, and was based at Malta.  However, she was transferred to the Home Fleet before the end of September 1939 to patrol the Western Approaches.  In this rôle, she escorted HM aircraft carrier , but was answering a distress signal from SS Kafirstan when Courageous was attacked and sunk.

It was named after Scottish astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth. This is an isolated feature located about 100 kilometers to the southwest of the Montes Alpes mountain range. To the southeast of this crater is Mons Piton, an isolated mountain that rises to a height of 2.3 km and occupies a diameter of about 25 km.

This crater is a nicely circular feature with a rim and interior that have not been significantly modified by impacts. The inner walls slope smoothly downwards to the small floor about the midpoint, which occupies a diameter of only one-fifth the total diameter of the crater. This formation has no other notable features, and its albedo matches the surrounding lava plain.

Satellite craters

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Piazzi Smyth.

It was discovered on 20 December 1965, by astronomers at the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanking, China. The asteroid was named for the Henan Province in China.

Orbit and classification 

Henan is the parent body of the Henan family (), a large family of L-type asteroids in the intermediate main-belt, which can be further divided into four distinct families.

It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.5–2.9 AU once every 4 years and 5 months (1,619 days; semi-major axis of 2.70 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic.

A first observation of this asteroid was found on a precovery, taken at the Lowell Observatory in July 1906. The body's observation arc begins at Goethe Link Observatory in July 1943, more than 22 years prior to its official discovery observation at Purple Mountain.

Physical characteristics 

In the Bus–DeMeo and SMASS classification, Henan is an uncommon L-type asteroid, which is also the overall spectral type for members of the Henan family.

Rotation period 

As of 2017, no secure rotational lightcurve of Henan has been obtained. In September 2004, observations by Laurent Bernasconi gave a rotation period of 24 hours with a brightness variation of 0.25 magnitude (). In February 2015, photometric observations of Henan by an international collaboration of astronomers gave a tentative synodic period of  hours and an amplitude of 0.4 magnitude, which would make it a potentially slow rotator (). An alternative period solution gave 94 hours. The latter study selected Henan because it is a suspected ""Barbarian"" asteroid (named after 234 Barbara) which polarimetric properties suggest that they have an unusual shape and topographic features with large concave ar",0,"2085 Henan, provisional designation, is a","2085 Henan, provisional designation, is a",10,1.4b

The region was part of the Côte d'Ivoire,","Croatian wine (, pl. ) has a history dating back to the Ancient Greek settlers, and their wine production on the southern Dalmatian islands of Vis, Hvar and Korčula some 2,500 years ago. Like other old world wine producers, many traditional grape varieties still survive in Croatia, perfectly suited to their local wine hills. Modern wine-production methods have taken over in the larger wineries, and EU-style wine regulations have been adopted, guaranteeing the quality of the wine.

There are currently over 300 geographically defined wine regions, and a strict classification system to ensure  quality and origin. The majority of Croatian wine is white, with most of the remainder being red, and only a small percentage is rosé wines. In 2014, Croatia ranked 32nd in wine producing countries with an estimated 45,272 tonnes.

Wine is a popular drink in Croatia, and locals traditionally like to drink wine with their meals. Quite often, the wine is diluted with either still or sparkling water – producing a drink known as  (a combination of white wine and carbonated water), and  (a combination of red wine and still water).

History 

Like the rest of Central Europe and Southern Europe, viticulture in the present-day Croatia existed hundreds of years before the rise of the Roman Empire. Recent research has shown that the Illyrians living in Dalmatia during the Bronze Age and Iron Age may already have grown grapevines. However, the true beginning of grape cultivation and wine production in Croatia is related to the Ancient Greeks settlers, who arrived on the Croatian coast in the 5th century BC. The Greek writer Athenaeus wrote 18 centuries ago about the high quality wine produced on the Dalmatian islands of Vis, Hvar and Korčula. Coins from the period have motifs related to grape cultivation and wine, demonstrating the importance of wine in the economics of the ancient Greek colonies.

Under the Roman Empire, wine production grew, becoming more organized. Wine wa",0,"Croatian wine (, pl. ) has a","Croatian wine (, pl. ) has a",10,1.4b

As with all Paralympic powerlifting events, lifters competed in the bench press. Each athlete was allowed three attempts to bench press as much weight as possible. Athletes attempting to break a record were allowed a fourth attempt. For the attempt to be valid, the competitor must have lowered the weighted bar to her chest, held it motionless for a moment, then pressed the bar upwards until her arms were fully extended. If the competitor failed to meet these requirements or any other rule infraction was committed, the attempt was declared invalid by a team of three referees and the result struck from the record.

Coastal Risk uses data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Flood Insurance Program, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, high-resolution LIDAR, local tide gauges, and various other geographic information systems to create their cloud-based climate impact risk analyses. However, Coastal Risk's risk scores differ from FEMA flood maps by including sea level rise projections into their flood risk calculations.

FEMA flood maps simply fail to provide comprehensive flood risk assessments for your property:

 FEMA flood maps cannot identify an individual property's flooding risks from heavy rainfall. Coastal Risk's reports model heavy rainfall flood risks for every property in the US.
 FEMA flood maps don’t include coastal tidal flooding risks to your home or business. Tidal flooding becomes a “threat multiplier” if a hurricane comes ashore at high tide. Coastal Risk's report shows a property's vulnerability to tidal flooding and to even more severe King Tides.
 FEMA flood maps underestimate the height of hurricane storm surge. The higher the surge, the greater the damage. Coastal Risk's reports incorporate more reliable NOAA models, providing realistic intelligence about water heights higher than FEMA's ""Base Flood Elevations"".

Members of The Imports later went on to play with the Vagueleys, Silly Carmichaels (a pre-Ministry Al Jourgensen project), Sharkey's Machine, ¡Ack-Ack!, The Arms of Someone New, Split Heavens, Sylvia Darling and The Moon Seven Times.

History 
The Imports formed in 1979 in Chicago's South Side Hyde Park neighborhood. The band consisted of Ben Krug (vocals), Tom Krug (guitar) and Joe Strell (bass). The Imports went through a series of drummers including John Krug, Alec Dale, who accompanied the outfit through its transition from punk rock to post-punk, and finally Tom Wall.

During their brief career, the Imports played the nightclub circuit of Chicago's underground music scene, a scene they shared with other Chicago punk rock and/or new wave music bands such as Bohemia, C*nts, Da!, the Dadistics, Epicycle, the Ferraris, Heavy Manners, the Men, Naked Raygun, the Oil Tasters (from Milwaukee), Painter Band, Phil 'n' the Blanks, Poison Squirrel, Skafish, Special Affect, Static Cling, the Subverts (from Rockford), the Sweatermen, the Throbbers, the Trouble Boys, and the Vaguelys.  As Ken Mierzwa writes in Ephemeral Creation:  Music and Art in Chicago, 1978-1982, ""none of the first batch of local bands ever enjoyed more than regional success"".  The nightclubs in which The Imports played included The Lucky Number, Tuts, Jamie's Elsewhere, and Exit. The majority of The Imports' band members were excluded from these venues on nights when they were not playing on account of being under the legal age for drinking, making it difficult for them to view acts who weren't on the same bill.

The abbreviation MV stands for Meccanica (mechanics) Verghera, the hamlet where the first MVs were made. The company manufactured small-displacement, café racer-style motorcycles (mostly 125 to 150 cc) through the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, small motorcycle sales declined, and MV started producing larger displacement cycles in more limited quantities. A 250 cc, and later a  350 cc twin were produced, and a 600 cc four-cylinder evolved into a 750 cc. The MV Agusta company was successful at racing during its founder's lifetime, winning multiple Grand Prix motorcycle racing world championships through 1976.

History

Racing philosophy (1945–1971)

The MV Agusta company began as an offshoot of the Agusta aviation company formed by Count Giovanni Agusta in 1923. The Count died in 1927, leaving the company in the hands of his wife and sons, Domenico, Vincenzo, Mario and Corrado. Count Vincenzo Agusta together with his brother Domenico formed MV Agusta at the end of the Second World War as a means of saving the jobs of employees of the Agusta firm and also to fill the post-war need for cheap, efficient transportation.

The brothers had a passion for mechanical workings and for motorcycle racing. Much like Enzo Ferrari, they produced and sold motorcycles almost exclusively to fund their racing efforts. They were determined to have the best Grand Prix motorcycle racing team in the world and spared no expense on their passion. MV Agusta produced their first prototype, called ""Vespa 98"", in 1945. After learning that the name had already been registered by Piaggio for its Vespa motorscooter, it was referred to simply by the number “98”. In 1948, the company built a 125 cc two-stroke single and entered Franco Bertoni in the Italian Grand Prix.

History

Pre-debut
Under the name Child of Empire, following their appearance on Mnet's Office Reality, the group gained attention by performing various guerilla shows and creating UCC (user created content) videos. They have also appeared in a documentary-styled show Star Empire, and later getting their own documentary show titled Empire Kids Returns, showing them performing in wingcar performances around Seoul and training. The group faced controversy in December following the similarities of the group's name to Brown Eyed Girls' JeA. The group later changed the pronunciation of the name to avoid confusion.

It is the first part of the Crosstime Traffic series.

Plot summary
In the novel, Jeremy and Amanda Solter are two teenagers living in the late 21st century. Their parents work for Crosstime Traffic, a trading company using time travel to go back and forth from parallel versions of Earth to trade for resources to help sustain their version of Earth. One summer, the children work with their parents, going to Polisso – in our timeline a village in Romania with the ancient Porolissum ruins nearby, in the alternate timeline a major city of a Roman Empire that never collapsed.

In the intervening centuries, the Romans advanced to the extent of inventing gunpowder – hence the title of the book – putting their armies on about 17th Century level. By 2100, they had not, however, gone through an industrial revolution and much of their social institutions, in particular slavery, remain much as they were in earlier Roman times. North of the Roman Empire, a rival Lietuvan Empire has grown up similar to a still surviving Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, with occasional wars breaking out between the two. It is said that most of these wars would end in an exchange of border provinces. Romans consider the Lietuvans as ""barbarians"", though in fact the two have much the same level of technology and culture.

When the youngsters' mother becomes sick, their father takes her back to their home time for treatment, expecting to come back in a few days – but the cross-time travel equipment suffers a break in link, stranding Jeremy and Amanda in Polisso just as the Lietuvan Army crosses the border, placing Polisso under siege. At the same time, the Roman authorities begin to grow suspicious of their trade mission and the origin of such items as watches and Swiss army knives which they offer for sale and which no artisan in the Empire can match.

","Lurene Tuttle (August 29, 1907 – May 28, 1986) was an American character actress and acting coach, who made the transition from vaudeville to radio, and later films and television. Her most enduring impact was as one of network radio's more versatile actresses. Often appearing in 15 shows per week, comedies, dramas, thrillers, soap operas, and crime dramas, she became known as the ""First Lady of Radio"".

Early years
Tuttle was born August 29, 1907, at Pleasant Lake, Indiana, into a family with strong ties to entertainment. Her father, Clair Vivien Tuttle (1883–1950), had been a performer in minstrel shows before becoming a station agent for a railroad. Her grandfather, Frank Tuttle, managed an opera house and taught drama. Her mother was Verna Sylvia (Long) Tuttle. She discovered her own knack for acting after moving with her family to Glendale, Arizona. She later credited a drama coach there for ""making me aware of life as it really is—by making me study life in real situations.""

After her family moved to Southern California, Tuttle appeared in productions at the Pasadena Playhouse before joining the vaudeville troupe Murphy's Comedians. By the time of the Great Depression, Tuttle had put her remarkable vocal versatility to work in radio, and within a decade, she became one of the most in-demand actresses in the medium.

Radio roles
Tuttle's radio debut came in 1936 when she appeared on Hollywood Hotel with Dick Powell. Despite having never performed before a microphone, Tuttle's audition won her a three-year contract with the program.

Thirteen years later, one newspaper columnist called her ""quite possibly the most-heard woman in America.""

On radio's The Adventures of Sam Spade she played just about every female role as well as Spade's secretary Effie Perrine. She appeared in such shows as The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet and concurrently appeared on The Great Gildersleeve as the niece Marjorie Forrester. Tuttle had regular roles in such shows",0,"Lurene Tuttle (August 29, 1907 –","Lurene Tuttle (August 29, 1907 –",10,1.4b

He studied for one year with Alfredo Piatti, for whom he deputised (taking his place in concerts when called upon), and was his favourite pupil. He went on to teach at the Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music and King's College, Cambridge; his students included Felix Salmond and Beatrice Harrison, who both became closely associated with Edward Elgar. He played with violinist Joseph Joachim, and formed 'The London Trio' with violinist Achille Simonetti and pianist Amina Goodwin. He edited Piatti's Caprices, with suggestions as to how his former teacher preferred them to be played.

","Artifodina strigulata is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from Meghalaya, India, and from Nepal.

The wingspan is 8.2-11.5 mm.

The larvae feed on Myrsine capitellata. They mine the leaves of their host plant. In early stages, the mine is narrow, linear, interparenchymal, and runs across the leaf from one edge to another twice or thrice, thus the leaf apical to the crossed mines is always discoloured into pale green or yellowish-green. Then, the mine enters into the main leaf-vein towards the apex or runs along the main vein. Sometimes it irregularly runs on the space between the edge and the main vein. In late stages, the mine is broadened into a large, blotchy one of the full-depth type within the discoloured area of the leaf. This type of mine seems to be made by the larvae of tissue-feeding form. Finally, a semitransparent, blotchy mine is seen on the discoloured apical area of the leaf. When full grown, the larva becomes ochre-yellowish with a crimson-reddish, broad, transverse band on each segment, and leaves the mine to pupate through a semicircular slit on the upper surface of the leaf. The cocoon is boat-shaped, with a few bubbles on the surface.

Category:Taxa named","Stigmella cypracma is a species of moth in the family Nepticulidae. It is endemic to New Zealand. The larvae of this species are leaf miners and pupate with their mines. The host species is Brachyglottis repanda. The adult moths are on the wing in February and September to November.

Taxonomy 
This species was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1916 using a specimen collected by George Hudson in November in Karori and named Nepticula cypracma. In 1919 Meyrick, thinking he was describing a new species, also named it Nepticula perissopa. He used as specimen collected by Hudson at Mount Taranaki. In 1928 Hudson described and illustrated the species under the name Nepticula cypracma and also describing it under the name Nepticula perissopa. However he expresses doubt at the distinction between the two species. In 1988 J. S. Dugdale places both these species within the genus Stigmella. In 1989 Hans Donner and Christopher Wilkinson synonymised Stigmella perissopa with Stigmella cypracma. 

The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London.

Description 
The larvae of S. cypracma are about 4 mm long and pale green. 

Meyrick described the adult moth of the species as follows:
S. cypracma can be distinguished from similar species S. ogygia and S. hakekeae as it has wings that are broader and more evenly coloured.

Distribution 
This species is endemic to New Zealand. Other than the type locality of Wellington, this species or its mines have been collected from Northland, Bay of Plenty, Taranaki, Whanganui, and Havelock.

Biology and behaviour
Larvae have been recorded from May to October and in December. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine is narrow and does not follow a particular pattern, but is strongly sinuous and tends to isolate within its coils areas of tissue which, when withered, can be recognised as brown patches in the leaf. The mine terminates in a blotch. The frass is deposited in one or two rows in the mid",1,Stigmella cypracma is a species of,Stigmella cypracma is a species of,10,1.4b

Career

Early years
Born in New York City, he was a member of the New York Giants from 1962 to 1965. He played college football at the University of New York. He was a member of the New York Giants from 1962","Alexander de Renzy (August 13, 1935 – June 8, 2001) was an American director and producer of pornographic movies.

Born in New York City, de Renzy served in the United States Air Force as a Survival Instructor. Back in the United States, he began making documentary films in San Francisco. In October 1969, he went to Denmark to attend Sex 69, the first porn trade show hosted in Copenhagen after the legalization of adult pornography there. This resulted in his first movie, Censorship in Denmark: A New Approach (1970), which was released the following year.

He was the editor on Sexual Encounter Group (1970), was a cinematographer on seven movies, and wrote five screenplays. His production Lady Freaks (1973) introduced porn star legend Annette Haven. His films also include the two 1970s porn classics Babyface (1977) and Pretty Peaches (1978).

Another de Renzy discovery was Desireé Cousteau. She won the Adult Film Association of America Award in 1978 for ""Best Actress"" for her starring role in Pretty Peaches and became an international sex star. The plot of Pretty Peaches derives from Voltaire's literary classic Candide about a naive young woman undergoing a series of hardships which constitute the satire.

Originally posted on her cousins' ""Canal Descontraídas"" YouTube Channel (the gêmeas lacração channel), this video went viral. While it was later deleted due to copyright issues, the original content was recovered by the singer and,as a result, many clips remain live on various YouTube channels.

Story
As the video begins, MC Loma and her dancers (her cousins and the gêmeas lacração) are eating pastries at a restaurant. MC Loma is then shown in a phone booth, and then she and her dancers are dancing in front of a train. Another scene shows the singer lying on a green background with a lipstick of the same color. In some scenes, she dances alone in a bar and in one scene she is dressed as a DJ.

DJ Torricelli version

""Meu Ritmo"" is a remix of the song with the same name by the Brazilian girl band, MC Loma e as Gêmeas Lacração and the Brazilian DJ Torricelli. This remix was selected by fans during a media campaign.

Story
The video was produced and released by the ""Start World"" YouTube channel, which belongs to the record label that would eventually sign the band. Like many other videos of her songs, this one is notable for its comedic elements. At the outset, girls are eating desserts in a candy store. A couple (played by Brazilian YouTuber's Muca Muriçoca and Carol Dias) are arguing close to the girls, because the boy was paying more attention to the girls in the candy store than to his girlfriend. Afterwards, the scene changes to show MC Loma talking on her phone. The girl band is dancing while the DJ plays the piano. At the end of the video, the man justifies looking at the girls by saying he wanted the sweets the singers were eating. In the end, the Brazilian journalist Dudu Camargo records the girls sitting at the table while the couple stands with them. The couple eventually reconcile, and everyone is happy.  This version is by DJ Toricelli.

RNKB is based in Simferopol and owned by the Federal Agency for State Property Management. The bank was assigned an A rating by the Russian ACRA rating agency.

Originally a subsidiary of VTB, it was acquired by the Crimean government weeks after the peninsula was annexed by Russia. While the bank has no formal ties to the VTB Group, its establishment as a separate entity was seen as a way to avoid the effect of sanctions.

The Russian National Commercial Bank took over numerous branches of banks that retreated from Crimea following Russia's Annexation thus making it the largest banking network in Crimea.

The bank has issued over a million Mir payment cards as of April 2017. Major companies such as Visa and MasterCard are barred from issuing cards to banks with a presence in Crimea.

According to Vedomosti, in August 2017 the software company Finastra refused to sell its SWIFT interface to the bank, effectively cutting it off from SWIFT.

Sanctions
Because of Russian interference in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea, the Russian National Commercial Bank is under sanctions by the European Union since July 30, 2014, Liechtenstein since July 31, 2014, Canada since August 6, 2014, Switzerland since August 27, 2014, Australia since September 2, 2014, and the United States since March 11, 2015.

John St. Louis Blues Club –","Memphis Underground is a 1969 album by jazz flutist Herbie Mann, that fuses the genres of jazz and rhythm and blues (R&B). While Mann and the other principal soloists (Roy Ayers, Larry Coryell and Sonny Sharrock) were leading jazz musicians, the album was recorded in Chips Moman's American Sound Studio in Memphis, a studio used by many well-known R&B and pop artists. The rhythm section was the house band at American Studios. The recording was engineered and produced by Tom Dowd.

Three of the five songs on the album were covers of songs originally released by soul artists.  ""Hold On, I'm Comin'"" (by Sam & Dave), who recorded at Stax records (with the Stax rhythm section), and ""Chain of Fools"" (by Aretha Franklin) who recorded that song with the classic Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section at Atlantic Studios in New York.

Two members of the rhythm section on Franklin's recording (Gene Chrisman and Tommy Cogbill) perform on Memphis Underground.

A third song, ""New Orleans"", was also released by R&B artist (Gary U.S. Bonds), who recorded in Virginia. 

So though the only one song was certifiably of Memphis vintage, the conglomeration of young New York jazz musicians with one of the most storied Southern rhythm sections proved to be the catalyst for creating strong, fresh music that sounds like neither Memphis soul nor New York jazz. This unique sound appealed to a large audience.

Reception
The record is one of the best-selling Jazz albums of all time. Rolling Stone said ""Memphis Underground is a piece of musical alchemy, a marvelously intricate combination of the ""Memphis sound"" and jazz lyricism"".  

Memphis Underground was a favorite album of writer Hunter S. Thompson, who mentions it positively in several chapters of his book Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail. In the article The Battle of Aspen, Thompson states that his ""Freak Power"" campaign used Mann's recording of ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" as the background music for their commercials.

Baptised","Jan Baptist Lambrechts (baptised 28 February 1680 - after 1731) was an 18th-century Flemish painter. He is mainly known for his genre scenes of drinkers, cooks, maids, vegetable salesmen and dancing farmers.

Life
Jan Baptist Lambrechts was born in Antwerp as the son of Jacob and Anna Deckers.  His parents died when he was still very young.  His stepbrother Jeroom Lambrechts allowed him to develop his artistic skills through self study. In 1703 he left for Lille with the purpose of selling paintings at the annual fair. This was followed by years of travelling.  

Jan Baptist Lambrechts only returned to Antwerp in 1709 where he became a master of the local Guild of St Luke.

He left his hometown Antwerp in 1731, not long before he died.

Work
Jan Baptist Lambrechts was a genre painter who specialised in tavern scenes and merry company scenes.  His preferred motifs included cooks, maids, vegetable salesmen, dancing farmers and drinkers.  He also created a singerie depicting a A cat judged by monkeys (At Sotheby's 29 - 30 January 2016 in New York, lot 682).

He was highly appreciated for his fine brushwork and detailed compositions. He was skilled in the rendering of  fine fabrics.

Examples of his artistic output can be found in the Uffizi in Florence and the Hermitage and also appear on the international art market.

""The Great Gatsby"" (Gil","Gilgal ( Gilgāl;  ""Galgalatokai of the Twelve Stones"") is the name of one or more places in the Hebrew Bible. Gilgal is mentioned 39 times, in particular in the Book of Joshua, as the place where the Israelites camped after crossing the Jordan River (Joshua 4:19 - 5:12). The Hebrew term Gilgal most likely means ""circle of stones"". Its name appears in Koine Greek on the Madaba Map.

Places named Gilgal in the Bible

In Joshua 4-5

According to Joshua 4:19, Gilgal is a location ""on the eastern border of Jericho"" where the Israelites encamped immediately after crossing the Jordan River. There, they erected 12 stones as a memorial to the miraculous stopping of the river when they crossed. Joshua then ordered the Israelites who had been born during the Exodus to be circumcised at this spot. The Bible refers to this place as Givat Ha'aralot, then says that Joshua called the place Gilgal because, in his words, ""today I have removed (galoti) the shame of Egypt from upon you.""

Some scholars speculate that the circle of 12 stones was the (unnamed) religious sanctuary that was condemned in Amos 4:4 and 5:5 and Hosea 4:15.

Elsewhere in Joshua
""The king of Goyim, of Gilgal"" is listed as one of the 31 kings defeated by Joshua. His city is identified by Eusebius with Jaljulia.

""Gilgal"" is mentioned as a location on the border between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, near Ma'ale Adumim.

In Deuteronomy
In the Book of Deuteronomy 11:29-30, Gilgal is a place across from Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal.

In the Book of Samuel
A place named Gilgal was included in Samuel's annual circuit, and is the location where he offered sacrifices after Saul was anointed as king, and where he renewed Saul's kingship together with the people.

Fides was the last of the main-belt asteroids to be assigned an iconic symbol. 37 Fides is also a S-type asteroid in the Tholen classification system.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at multiple observatories during 1981–82 gave an unusual light curve with three minima and maxima. The curve changed with varying phase angle of the asteroid relative to the viewer and the position of the Sun, indicating the changing influence of shadows cast by surface features. The composite light curve has a best fit period estimate of 7.33 hours. Austrian astronomer Hans Josef Schober has suggested that the multiple minima and maxima during each period may be an indication of a binary nature.

Many structural features are unique to bacteria and are not found among archaea or eukaryotes. Because of the simplicity of bacteria relative to larger organisms and the ease with which they can be manipulated experimentally, the cell structure of bacteria has been well studied, revealing many biochemical principles that have been subsequently applied to other organisms.

Cell morphology 

Perhaps the most elemental structural property of bacteria is their morphology (shape). Typical examples include:
 coccus (circle or spherical)
 bacillus (rod-like)
 coccobacillus (between a sphere and a rod)
 spiral (corkscrew-like)
 filamentous (elongated)
Cell shape is generally characteristic of a given bacterial species, but can vary depending on growth conditions. Some bacteria have complex life cycles involving the production of stalks and appendages (e.g. Caulobacter) and some produce elaborate structures bearing reproductive spores (e.g. Myxococcus, Streptomyces). Bacteria generally form distinctive cell morphologies when examined by light microscopy and distinct colony morphologies when grown on Petri plates.

Perhaps the most obvious structural characteristic of bacteria is (with some exceptions) their small size. For example, Escherichia coli cells, an ""average"" sized bacterium, are about 2 µm (micrometres) long and 0.5 µm in diameter, with a cell volume of 0.6–0.7 μm3. This corresponds to a wet mass of about 1 picogram (pg), assuming that the cell consists mostly of water. The dry mass of a single cell can be estimated as 23% of the wet mass, amounting to 0.2 pg. About half of the dry mass of a bacterial cell consists of carbon, and also about half of it can be attributed to proteins. Therefore, a typical fully grown 1-liter culture of Escherichia coli (at an optical density of 1.",1,"The bacterium, despite its simplicity, contains a well-","The bacterium, despite its simplicity, contains a well-",10,1.4b

In natural language

In informatics, natural language processing, and machine translation, a sublanguage is the language of a restricted domain, particularly a technical domain. In mathematical terms, ""a subset of the sentences of a language forms a sublanguage of that language if it is closed under some operations of the language: e.g., if when two members of a subset are operated on, as by and or because, the resultant is also a member of that subset"" (Z. S. Harris Language and Information, Columbia U. Press, 1988, p. 34).

In computer languages
The term sublanguage has also sometimes been used to denote a computer language that is a subset of another language. A sublanguage may be restricted syntactically (it accepts a subgrammar of the original language), and/or semantically (the set of possible outcomes for any given program is a subset of the possible outcomes in the original language).

Examples
For instance, ALGOL 68S was a subset of ALGOL 68 designed to make it possible to write a single-pass compiler for this sublanguage.

SQL (Structured Query Language) statements are classified in various ways, which can be grouped into sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL), a data definition language (DDL), a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language (DML).

In relational database theory

In relational database theory, the term ""sublanguage"", first used for this purpose by E. F. Codd in 1970, refers to a computer language used to define or manipulate the structure and contents of a relational database management system (RDBMS). Typical sublanguages associated with modern RDBMS's are QBE (Query by Example) and SQL (Structured Query Language). In 1985, Codd encapsulated his thinking in twelve rules which every database must satisfy in order to be truly relational. The fifth rule is known as the Compre",0,A sublanguage is a subset of a language.,A sublanguage is a subset of a language.,10,1.4b

He was arrested in October 2002 and sentenced to five years in prison for stating at a 'People's Conference' in Tripoli that reform in Libya would require a constitution, free speech and democracy. He was briefly released in March 2004 after U.S. Senator Joe Biden met with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and then re-imprisoned after calling for democratization of Libya in a television interview.  In early 2004 he, his wife, and his eldest son were taken into custody.

The Libyan government claimed that Eljahmi was put on trial in late 2005, accused of the capital charges of ""trying to overthrow the government, insulting Col. Gaddafi and contacting foreign authorities, after he talked to a US diplomat."" Physicians for Human Rights reported at the time that he was receiving inadequate care for heart disease and diabetes. During her visit to Libya, the United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice pleaded for Eljahmi's release from solitary detention. Eljahmi remained imprisoned. Writing in Forbes in 2009, Fathi's brother Mohamed criticised the lack of support that Eljahmi had received from human rights organisations, stating that ""for nearly a year, both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch hesitated to advocate publicly for Fathi's case, because they feared their case workers might lose access to Libyan visas.""

Eljahmi died on 21 May 2009 in Amman, Jordan, where he had been evacuated for emergency medical treatment after falling into a coma in Libyan custody.

The hill's eastern slopes forms the western side of Leith Valley, the other side of which consists of the flank of Mount Cargill. The Leith Saddle is 2500 metres to the east of Swampy Summit's peak. Both the Water of Leith and the Waitati River (which forms the valley on the north side of the Leith Saddle) have their sources on Swampy Summit's eastern flank.

As the name suggests, a regionally significant  of wetland lies to the southeast, close to the peak of Swampy Summit. The wetland is largely composed of peat bog which formed in a hollow near the summit, over which sphagnum moss has grown. Beyond the wetland lies a subordinate peak, Swampy Spur.

To the west of Swampy Summit, the land falls away to form the valley of Whare Creek (McKenzie's Creek), a tributary of the Silver Stream. A ridge connects the hill with another prominent peak, Flagstaff, which lies five kilometres to the south.

The slopes of Swampy Summit are the site of several walking and mountain biking tracks, one of which — the Swampy Ridge Track — ascends to the hill's peak. The first track on Swampy Summit was formed in the 1840s by early settler Johnny Jones to ease his travels between his farm near Waikouaiti and the new settlement of Dunedin. A private access road also climbs to the summit, built during the 1960s when a telecommunications equipment was placed on and close to the summit.

The first short, which is the one most widely available, is approximately six minutes long and features art deco style animations combined with film of the live-action performer (in this case, organist Milton Charles). The music for the first short was arranged by Frank Marsales, who was also the composer of the music for the earliest Looney Tunes, produced at approximately the same time as ""Cryin' for the Carolines.""  For its time those shorts are considered to be innovative and could be considered to be one of the earliest music videos. Production on this series ceased in 1931, and it was replaced with an animation-only series called Merrie Melodies in 1931, also produced by Leon Schlesinger.

""Love → Building on","""Love → Building on Fire"" (read as ""Love Goes to Building on Fire"") is a song by rock band Talking Heads, released as a single in 1977. The single preceded the band's debut album by seven months. As the single was the first piece of music released commercially by the band, its release is cited as a milestone in the band's history in its Rock and Roll Hall of Fame entry.

The song did not appear on any of the band's original studio albums, though it was later included on their 1992 compilation album Sand in the Vaseline: Popular Favorites and as a bonus track on a reissue of Talking Heads: 77. A live recording of the song is featured on their live album The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads.

Personnel
The song was written by David Byrne. The original recorded version was produced by Tony Bongiovi. The horns in the song were arranged by Brad Baker and Lance Quinn. Mastered by Ted Jensen.

Artistic impressions of the song
Jerry Harrison called ""Love → Building on Fire"" one of his favorite songs to play live, despite the fact the song was recorded before he joined the band. Harrison stated that he and Byrne ""used to get a wonderful interplay of guitars that was a bit like early Television"". However, he felt that the best live performances were never recorded.

He is called the champion of Dutch democracy.

Life

Ondaatje was born at Colombo on Ceylon, as the son of a minister. His mother came from Amsterdam. He had a dark complexion as his father was descended from Europeans on the island, known as ""burghers"". At the age of 14 year he came to Amsterdam, becoming a pupil at the Athenaeum Illustre. He then moved to Utrecht to study law and theology.  He rented a room in the same building as the poet Jacobus Bellamy, who complained about the noise Ondaatje caused in the building.  Ondaatje became an officer in the exercitiegenootschap exercising in the Sterrebos. He wrote petitions to the vroedschap on the rights and responsibilities of the stadholder concerning the appointment of new candidates.

On 11 March 1785 Utrecht's population came en masse to the city hall.  They then entered the city hall under the leadership of Ondaatje, who made a fierce speech demanding the resignation of Sichterman if the regenten would not yield. He added that it would hard to leave the hall since many people were standing in the doorway.  The regenten decided to give in, provided that Ondaatje would calm down the people.  From the steps Ondaatje announced their victory and asked the people to go to their homes.  The crowd dispersed but, when the danger had passed, further assemblies were banned and Ondaatje arrested for disturbing the peace and sent to jail.

In May 1785 Ondaatje and his friend Von Liebeherr traveled many times to the Hague to get access to the stadholder William V of Orange. Ondaatje was forced to defend himself in the patriot newspaper De Post van den Neder-Rhijn.

Demographics

As of the census of 2000","Minco is a city in Grady County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,632 at the 2010 census.

History 
Present-day Minco began as a settlement named Silver City on the Chisholm Trail. The community was initially a collection of tents housing Caddo, Wichita, Kiowa, and Comanche tribesmen.  It was about  east of the present-day location. After the Rock Island extended its railroad track to the Chisholm Trail, the town physically moved to the end of the rail line and renamed itself Minco.
The town was originally included in the Chickasaw Nation, and is believed to be named after the great Chickasaw chief and warrior, Itawamba Minco, who later acquired the name of Levi Colbert, and who resided on Chickasaw land in Mississippi near Cotton Gin Port.

Minco was officially settled sometime around 1890, several years before Oklahoma achieved statehood. The post office opened on July 14, 1890. In its early stages it was a very busy town because of its location at the end of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad until the railroad was extended further south two years later. Charles B. Campbell owned the occupancy rights of the land that the town was built on. His wife was Miss Maggie (Margaret) Williams, a daughter of W. G. (Caddo Bill) Williams, owner of the Half Moon Ranch, who started Silver City in 1872 by building a trading store for those cattlemen driving their herds of cattle up the Chisholm Trail.

Before the establishment of Minco as a town, three major expeditions passed through the area. The first expedition was conducted by Captain Randolph B. Marcy(1812-1887) in 1849. Marcy was ordered to escort 1,500 individuals headed to the California gold fields. When the expedition approached the Minco area they kept to the south side of Buggy Creek, which Marcy named ""Deer Creek"". Marcy named his route the Fort Smith to Santa Fe Trail. There was a road established in 1839-1840 on the north side of the Canadian River that was also named the F",0,"Minco is a city in Grady County,","Minco is a city in Grady County,",10,1.4b

It started operations on 23 May 1972 with a Nice-Montpellier-Perpignan service.  In 1975 it was headquartered at Aérodrome du Castellet.

Over the years KLM, Euralair, Lufthansa and the SAir Group (Swissair), who sold their stake in 2001, all had ownership stakes in Air Littoral. A takeover failed in 2003 and the company was declared bankrupt. A number of groups considered taking over Air Littoral including Azzurra Air (which shortly after ceased operations due to its own financial difficulties), but none succeeded and the airline was closed down by the French authorities in February 2004.

Fleet & History
In different periods of its history the company was operating the following aircraft:
 ATR 42;
 ATR 72;
 Beechcraft 1900;
 Boeing 737-300;
 Bombardier CRJ;
 Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante (4);
 Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia;
 Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner;
 Fokker F27 Friendship;
 Fokker 70;
 Fokker 100;
 Nord 262.

By the moment of bankruptcy Air Littoral had been operating a fleet of 17 CRJ-100s from bases in Nice, Montpellier, Paris (Orly) and Marseille, and was well known for the bright livery its aircraft sported in the years before its demise.

In the 1990s, Air Littoral approached Metzler & Associés of Paris for a new identity which would propel it into a new market, and that is what was delivered. However, the design, a mix-and-match collection of identity elements, was so innovative that the airline's executives were afraid to implement it - until they called a company-wide meeting and showed Air Littoral employees models of the aircraft painted in the vivid new style. Marc-Antoine Herrmann, creative director & lead designer for the project told airline officers, ""We must show all the positive things associated with the south - its warmth, friendliness, joie de vivre. This is your difference, and you must use it so",1,Air Littoral was an airline in France founded in,Air Littoral was an airline in France founded in,10,1.4b

She was born in Vienna, daughter of Břetislav Lvovsky (1857–1910), a minor Czech opera composer. She studied theater, dance, and languages at the Austrian Royal Academy of Arts and Music. She is best known to fans of Star Trek as the original T'Pau, and to fans of The Twilight Zone as the aged mother of an eternally youthful Hollywood actress.

Life and career 

Lovsky married journalist Heinrich Vinzenz Nowak in 1919. By 1925, they were apparently estranged and she was romantically involved with playwright Arthur Schnitzler. She later moved to Berlin, where she acted in the surrealist plays Dream Theater and Dream Play by Karl Kraus. There, in 1929, she met Peter Lorre, who had seen her in a production of Shakespeare's Othello near Vienna. The couple traveled to Paris, London, and the United States. Lovsky was instrumental in bringing Lorre to the attention of Fritz Lang, leading eventually to Lorre's appearance in the film M (1931) directed by Lang. They lived together for five years before their marriage, and stayed married until 1945, remaining close friends for the rest of Lorre's life.

After the couple settled in Santa Monica, California, Lorre had not wished Lovsky to work, believing he should be the breadwinner and she should remain at home. For the rest of Lorre's life, she was his publicist, manager, secretary, financial planner, nurse and confidant. However, after their divorce, she started taking roles in American movies and television. She made a name for herself playing slightly exotic roles such as the deaf-mute mother of Lon Chaney in Man of a Thousand Faces (1957) with James Cagney and Apache Princess Saba in the 1955 film Foxfire starring Jane Russell and Jeff Chandler.

It was started in 1985 as an outgrowth of a Field Artillery Officer Advanced Course battlefield research project at the U.S. Army Field Artillery School (USAFAS) to develop a concept for incorporating PCs into artillery training, and was completed in 1986.  It replaced summer artillery live fire training for cadets at West Point in 1986 and 1987.

One of the USAFAS students involved in the battlefield research project, Captain (later Colonel) Bill Erwin, volunteered to continue to develop the concept into an actual application during his follow-on assignment to the USAFAS Directorate of Training and Doctrine.

Versions:

MINITSFO - Original version using a Digital Message Device (DMD), virtual map, and CGA graphics.

VTSFO - Replaced the DMD with keyboard interface for use at West Point.

NGFTSFO - Naval Gunfire version using EGA graphics, actual scenes from San Clemente Island training area, and incorporating effects of dispersion between rounds.

Evolution of a military video game

As originally envisioned, the MiniTSFO would be a complete system that required only a computer to play.  This meant that there had to be some way to see targets on-screen, some way to locate the target coordinates such as a map, and some way to call for fire.  This resulted in a combination of three screens which the user could flip back-and-forth by using function keys.  The first screen showed a simulated view through an AN/GVS-5 laser rangefinder.  The map screen was a depiction of the fictional German town of Nitzburg and surrounding area.  Lastly, the way to enter firing commands was a virtual AN/PSG-2 Digital Message Device (DMD).

The virtual DMD required extensive programming in order to simulate the actual operation of a real DMD and consumed most of the program code space.

","A stud farm or stud in animal husbandry is an establishment for selective breeding of livestock. The word ""stud"" comes from the Old English stod meaning ""herd of horses, place where horses are kept for breeding"". Historically, documentation of the breedings that occur on a stud farm leads to the development of a stud book.  Male animals made available for breeding to outside female animals are said to be ""standing at stud"", or at ""stud service"", referencing the relatively high probability that they are kept at a stud farm.

The word stud is often restricted to larger domesticated (especially farm) animals, such as cattle and horses.  A specialized vocabulary exists for the studs of other animals, such as kennel (dog), cattery (cat) and aviary (birds).

Horse stud farms

Monastic stud farms
During the Middle Ages, stud farms were often managed as part of a monastery. At the time, few people apart from monks could read and write, and so they were charged with the responsibility of recording pedigrees. The Carthusian monks are famous for their role in breeding the Andalusian horse in Spain, while monasteries in Bavaria were responsible for the original Rottaler horse.

State stud farms

A state stud farm (, ) is one that is owned by the government. The first state studs were ordered by Louis XIV of France in 1665. The purpose of the state studs was to make high-quality horses available to local breeders and farmers to accelerate the evolution of local horses. Stud farms which kept a herd of mares in addition to stallions were dubbed ""Principal"" Studs. State-owned stallions were made accessible with low or no stud fees. Germany is most famous for its Principal and State Studs, which have been instrumental in the shaping of the German riding horses and several breeds of German cold bloods.

Arnold, 533 F.3d 1003 (9th Cir. 2008), is a United States court case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not require government agents to have reasonable suspicion before searching laptops or other digital devices at the border, including international airports.

This decision has caused worry and some controversy among Fourth Amendment advocates, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Especially troubled are those that legitimately store sensitive business, legal, or customer data; who worry that federal agents might leak information found from laptop searches. Several legislators have discussed and introduced measures to counter the ruling in order to provide more protection to travelers, but none have become law.

Background to the case
On July 17, 2005, Michael Arnold arrived at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) after spending a three-week vacation in the Philippines. After retrieving his luggage, Arnold proceeded through the checkpoint at customs. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer Laura Peng saw Arnold waiting in line and selected him for secondary questioning.

Peng questioned Arnold, and began inspecting his luggage, noting a laptop computer and several computer accessories. Peng instructed Arnold to turn on the computer so she could see if it was functioning. CBP Officer John Roberts was called to assist with the inspection while the computer was booting up.

Among the icons displayed on the computer's desktop, two were named ""Kodak Pictures"" and one was named ""Kodak Memories"". Peng and Roberts opened these folders, began viewing the photos, and noted one that depicted two nude women.

They are placed along with other drongos in the family Dicruridae. They are conspicuous in the forest habitats often perching in the open and by attracting attention with a wide range of loud calls that include perfect imitations of many other birds. One hypothesis suggested is that these vocal imitations may help in the formation of mixed-species foraging flocks, a feature seen in forest bird communities where many insect feeders forage together. These drongos will sometimes steal insect prey caught or disturbed by other foragers in the flock and another idea is that vocal mimicry helps them in diverting the attention of smaller birds to aid their piracy. They are diurnal but are active well before dawn and late at dusk. Owing to their widespread distribution and distinctive regional variation, they have become iconic examples of speciation by isolation and genetic drift.

Taxonomy
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the greater racket-tailed drongo in his Ornithologie based on a specimen that had been collected in Thailand (Siam). He used the French name Le Coucou Verd Hupé de Siam and the Latin Cuculus Siamensis Cristatus Viridis. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the greater racket-tailed drongo. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Cuculus paradiseus and cited Brisson's work. The current genus Dicrurus was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 18",0,The greater racket-tailed drongo (Dic,The greater racket-tailed drongo (Dic,10,1.4b

The alliance contested the election by fielding candidates from participating parties as independents in order to bypass the 10% election threshold needed to win seats in the Turkish Grand National Assembly. The alliance's candidates won a total of 1,334,518 votes and 22 seats in the election.

Lacking a realistic prospect of gaining parliamentary representation due to the 10% threshold, the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP), the socialist libertarian Freedom and Solidarity Party (ÖDP), the Labour Party (EMEP) and the Socialist Democracy Party (SDP) joined forces and decided to field candidates under a joint alliance, hence creating the Thousand Hope alliance. The alliance stated that its candidates included individuals who could extend the appeal of the political left to the general public, having also extended support to other left-wing candidates who were not part of the four member parties. The alliance fielded 65 candidates in 40 provinces. The Labour Party and the Freedom and Solidarity Party fielded their own candidates in the remaining 41 provinces but fell well short of the 10% electoral threshold.

The alliance was also in favour of minority rights, having openly campaigned as 'Kurds wanting peace'. Segments of society such as the LGBT community, which the alliance claimed had faced discrimination and oppression, played a major role in alliance's election campaign. Critics branded the alliance as Kurdish nationalist, pointing to the pro-Kurdish DTP, which was the biggest of the four participating parties.

A similar alliance, namely the Labour, Democracy and Freedom Bloc, was formed in preparation for the 2011 general election four years later.

Category:","Michael Cusack (; Irish: Mícheál Ó Cíosóig; 20 September 1847 – 27 November 1906) was an Irish teacher and founder of the Gaelic Athletic Association.

Life

Cusack was born to Irish speaking parents, in the parish of Carron on the eastern fringe of the Burren, County Clare, in 1847, during the Irish Potato Famine. Cusack became a national school teacher, and after teaching in various parts of Ireland became a professor in 1874 in Blackrock College, then known as the French College. In 1877, Cusack established his own Civil Service Academy, 'Cusack's Academy' in Dublin which proved successful in preparing pupils for the civil service examinations.

A romantic nationalist, Cusack was also ""reputed"" to have been associated with the Fenian movement. He was active in the Gaelic revival: a member of the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language which was founded in 1876, and later the Gaelic League who in 1879 broke away from the Society. Also in 1879, Cusack met Pat Nally, who was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and a leading nationalist and athlete. Cusack found that Nally's views on the influence of British landlordism on Irish athletics were the same as his. Cusack would recall how both Nally and himself while walking through the Phoenix Park in Dublin seeing only a handful of people playing sports in the park so depressed them that they agreed it was time to ""make an effort to preserve the physical strength of [their] race.""

Biography
Born in Frederiksberg, Hartz was first instructed in art at the age of 19 by the German Expressionist painter, Fritz Urschbach who aroused his interest in naturalism.  He studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen under Sigurd Wandel and Aksel Jørgensen where he quickly gained a reputation as a talented artist.

Suffering from schizophrenia, his health deteriorated from about 1935, requiring him to be hospitalised more and more frequently. Yet even after permanent hospitalisation in Nykøbing Sjælland in 1942, he continued to paint, participating in the exhibitions of the Corner group of which he had been a founding member. Many of his works depict scenes from Odsherred in the northwest of Zealand. He is considered to be a member of the group of artists known as the Odsherred Painters, especially as he joined them in forming Corner.

Hartz' earlier portraits, landscapes and still lifes were characterised by thick layers of paint. With time, the human form disappeared as his style became more sketchy. The once vivid colours were increasingly thinned down. Ultimately he reverted just to drawings and watercolours. 

Hertz died on 22 September 1987 in Nykøbing Sjælland.

The Holstebro Museum of Art in north-west Jutland holds the largest collection of Lauritz Hartz’ works with over 3,000 of his drawings and paintings.

Awards
Hartz was awarded the Eckersberg Medal in 1940 and the Thorvaldsen Medal in 1967.

They first journeyed to Santa Fe, New Mexico from Kaskaskia, Illinois in 1739.

First expedition

Pierre Antoine Mallet (b. 20 June 1700, d. after 1750) and his brother Paul Mallet (b. ?, d. 1753, Arkansas Post, Arkansas), were born in Montreal, Canada and moved to Detroit in 1706 and Kaskaskia, Illinois in 1734.  From Kaskaskia, in 1739, they attempted to travel to Santa Fe, New Mexico with six companions and nine horses loaded with trade goods. They followed the Missouri River north to South Dakota to the villages of the Arikara.  It was believed at the time that the Missouri River flowed all the way to the Spanish colonies in New Mexico.  Told by the Indians that New Mexico was to the southwest, they backtracked to the Pawnee villages on the Loup River in Nebraska.  From there on May 29, 1739, they embarked for Santa Fe.

The Mallet’s account of their journey to Santa Fe was lost and their route can only be roughly approximated.  They followed the Platte and South Platte River, which they called the River of the Padoucas (Padoucas probably refers to the Apache Indians who had inhabited this area a few years earlier).  They followed the South Platte upstream to approximately the Colorado-Nebraska border, then turned south.  While crossing a river (probably the Republican), they lost seven horses loaded with merchandise.  They reached the Arkansas River near the Kansas-Colorado line and followed it upstream.

On July 5, probably near present-day La Junta, Colorado they encountered a village of “Laitane” Indians (Comanche).  Among the Comanche was an Arikara Indian slave whom they hired as a guide to lead them to Santa Fe.  He led them, probably following a route approximating the later Santa Fe Trail to Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico where they first met Spaniards and were “pleasantly",0,"Pierre Antoine and Paul Mallet, brothers and","Pierre Antoine and Paul Mallet, brothers and",10,1.4b

He graduated from Northwestern University in 1923, where he played football, and became an ad executive. He first worked for The Coca-Cola Company, as vice president of marketing.

He became the CEO of the Pepsi-Cola Company in 1949. Under his management, sales tripled between 1955 and 1957. He reduced the sugar content of Pepsi products and introduced them to developing countries. He worked for Pepsi until his death from a heart attack in April 1959.

He was the fourth and last husband of actress Joan Crawford (married May 10, 1955, in Las Vegas). Herbert L. Barnet, Steele's handpicked successor as chairman and CEO, appointed her to the Board of Directors. In Joan Crawford's later career, product placement for Pepsi can be seen in several films, including Strait-Jacket (1964) and Berserk!

He was still a child when his father, Guigues III, died on the Fourth Crusade and he inherited Forez. His mother was Alix and his uncle, Renaud, archbishop of Lyon, acted as regent until he came of age in 1218.

Guigues's first wife was Mahaut, daughter of Guy II of Dampierre. In 1223, Guigues granted a communal charter to the town of Montbrison. On 16 April 1224, he returned the places of Saint-Rambert, Bonson, Chambles, Saint-Cyprien and Saint-Just to the monastery of Île Barbe, declaring that they were allods held freely and that he and his predecessors had unjustly possessed them. In 1224, Guigues also founded a collegiate church of thirteen canons at Montbrison, dedicating it to the Virgin Mary. The foundation of Notre-Dame-d'Espérance was confirmed by Archbishop Renaud in October 1224. The charter of foundation mandated that the canons be in residence for at least six months of the year.

In 1226, Guigues married Matilda, daughter of Peter II of Courtenay, countess of Nevers and widow of Hervé IV of Donzy. With the death of her son-in-law, Guy of Châtillon that same year, Guigues became count of Nevers.

In 1235, Guigues joined the Barons' Crusade. He came from an illustrious crusading family. His father had gone on the Fourth Crusade and his ancestor Count William III had joined the First Crusade. Likewise, his wife's family had crusaders in every generation going back to the Crusade of 1101. Guigues IV's primary motivation for crusading was to remove the sentence of excommunication that had been placed him for the alleged spoliation of monasteries and sheltering heretics. Likewise, by taking the crusader vow Guigues received relief from interest payments on his large debts and extensions on repayment of principal.

Borwick was the son of George Borwick of Torquay, and his wife Jane (née Hudson), and was Chairman of the family firm George Borwick & Sons Ltd, manufacturer of baking and custard powders, which had been founded by his father. 

Robert Borwick was made a Knight Bachelor in 1902 and created a Baronet (in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom), of Eden Lacy in the County of Lancaster, in 1916. 

In 1922 he was further honoured when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Borwick, of Hawkshead in the County of Lancaster, for ""providing hospital treatment for the sick and wounded Colonial officers throughout the war"".

He was also a Knight of Grace of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.

Lord Borwick married in 1872, Caroline (d. April 1936), daughter of the Reverend Richard Daniel Johnston of Kurnool, India. They had two sons and seven daughters. Latterly the family resided almost continually in Nice and Paris. 

He died in January 1936, aged 91, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son George. He is buried in the Cimetière du Château in Nice.

The name of the Kentucky farmer was","Kentucky is an agricultural producer in the United States. Value of agricultural products was $5 billion in 2012, of which slightly less than half was crops. Crops grown in the state include corn, soybeans, hay, wheat and tobacco. Historically, hemp has been a cash crop in the state (see hemp in Kentucky). Finished agricultural products produced in the state include Kentucky bourbon and Kentucky wine.

Agricultural regions
Kentucky's bluegrass region contains the state's best farmland. By contrast, the agricultural potential of the Knobs region (which borders the Bluegrass region) is limited because of its inferior soil and steep topography.

The Pennyroyal is also a productive agricultural region.

Agriculture in Kentucky's economy
In Kentucky, farm employment makes up an estimated 0.7% of total employment, and the agricultural sector accounts for about 2% of Kentucky's GDP. Agriculture as a percentage of the state's GDP has declined over time; in 1963 agriculture accounted for an estimated 5% of the state's GDP. In 2007, the state had 85,260 farms; by 2012, this number had declined to 77,064. In 2013, the average market value of agricultural products per farm in Kentucky was $65,755.

Agricultural products
Kentucky's most important agricultural products in terms of cash receipts were poultry (22% of projected 2015 sales), equine (16%), cattle (16%), soybeans (13%) and corn (13%). Other products, including hogs, dairy, tobacco, goats, and horticulture, play smaller roles.

Tobacco was the state's leading cash crop by the middle of the 19th century, producing over 53 million pounds in 1840 and over 108 million pounds in 1860, and continuing to increase until its peak in 1982 at 589 million pounds.

Participation can range from books with texture to those with special devices used to help teach children certain tools. Interactive children's books may also incorporate modern technology or be computerized books. Movable books, a subsection of interactive books, are defined as ""covering pop-ups, transformations, tunnel books, volvelles, flaps, pull-tabs, pop-outs, pull-downs, and more, each of which performs in a different manner. Also included, because they employ the same techniques, are three-dimensional greeting cards.""

Volvelles
The earliest form of interactive books are thought to be volvelles, a type of movable book with a wheel, which at the time was used to help display astrological and geographical maps.

Pop-up books 
It wasn't until the late nineteenth century, partly due to the invention of industrial printing, that pop-ups were created. The first pop-up books published in America were those in the Showman Series published by the McLoughlin Brothers. Still, these books were too expensive and fragile to be practical children's books. Pop-ups opened the door for the creation of many other types of interactive books for both children and adults. Despite a brief decline in production during the mid-twentieth century, it was a new idea that spawned quickly and eventually became the highly technological and advanced world of books that it is today.

Coloring books 
The coloring book format, of line drawings to which the child adds color, has been in production since the early 20th century.

Gamebooks 
Gamebooks are much like traditional books, but they offer the reader decisions throughout the book, with the decisions affecting the outcome of the story.  At each decision point, the reader is instructed to go to a particular page and/or paragraph to continue the story.  The first gamebook debuted in 1941.

Originally a car salesman in San Diego, Elgindy became a stock trader in 1988, working for penny stock brokerage Blinder Robinson. He later moved to another brokerage house, Armstrong McKinley. Soon afterward, when the firm came under investigation for taking bribes to recommend stock, he turned informer and helped get the firm shut down. He struck out on his own in 1995, becoming a short seller. He soon became known for exposing companies that he believed were engaging in unethical and illegal activity that inflated their stock.

Elgindy became famous for posting his commentaries on short-selling message boards, and his reputation became such that he could send a stock into a tailspin with just one post. He launched Pacific Equity Investigations in 1999, using his earlier experience working in boiler rooms to expose fraud.

After the turn of the century, Elgindy began working with FBI agent Jeff Broyer. Elgindy gave Broyer the names of companies that he believed were engaging in illegal activity, and Broyer used FBI databases to search for any investigations into those companies by the FBI or the SEC. Broyer then funneled information on any pending investigations to Elgindy, who used that information to short the stock. He was not above extorting executives into giving him stock in order to make him back off his attacks on them.

In 2003, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) ruled that Elgindy and his firm Key West Securities ""engaged in a manipulative scheme in 1997 to inflate artificially the share price of Saf T Lok, Inc. through the entering of fraudulent quotations in the NASDAQ system, selling the stock short at the artificially high prices, and then taking active steps to depress the share price of Sa",0,"Anthony Elgindy (November 28, 1967 –","Anthony Elgindy (November 28, 1967 –",10,1.4b

The housing is also a large open space with a high density of windows.","Housing First is a relatively recent innovation in human service programs and social policy regarding treatment of people who are homeless and is an alternative to a system of emergency shelter/transitional housing progressions. Rather than moving homeless individuals through different ""levels"" of housing, whereby each level moves them closer to ""independent housing"" (for example: from the streets to a public shelter, and from a public shelter to a transitional housing program, and from there to their own apartment in the community), Housing First moves the homeless individual or household immediately from the streets or homeless shelters into their own accommodation.

Housing First approaches are based on the concept that a homeless individual or household's first and primary need is to obtain stable housing, and that other issues that may affect the household can and should be addressed once housing is obtained. In contrast, many other programs operate from a model of ""housing readiness"" — that is, that an individual or household must address other issues that may have led to the episode of homelessness prior to entering housing.

General principles
Housing First is an approach that offers permanent, affordable housing as quickly as possible for individuals and families experiencing homelessness, and then provides the supportive services and connections to the community-based supports people need to keep their housing and avoid returning to homelessness. The principles behind this approach are:

 Move people into housing directly from streets and shelters without preconditions of treatment acceptance or compliance;
 The provider is obligated to bring robust support services to the housing. These services are predicated on assertive engagement, not coercion;
 Continued tenancy is not dependent on participation in services;
 Units targeted to most disabled and vulnerable homeless members of the community;
 Embraces harm-reduction approach to addiction",0,Housing First is a relatively recent innovation in human,Housing First is a relatively recent innovation in human,10,1.4b

It is located  inland from the French research station at Dumont D'Urville,  inland from Australia's Casey Station and  inland from the Italian Zucchelli Station at Terra Nova Bay. Russia's Vostok Station is  away. The Geographic South Pole is  away. The facility is also located within Australia's claim on Antarctica, the Australian Antarctic Territory.

Concordia Station is the third permanent, all-year research station on the Antarctic Plateau besides Vostok Station (Russian) and the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station (U.S.) at the Geographic South Pole. It is jointly operated by scientists from France and Italy and regularly hosts ESA scientists.

History 

In 1992, France decided to build a new station on the Antarctic Plateau. The program was later joined by Italy in 1993.

In 1995, Pr. Jean Vernin from University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis and Pr. Giorgio Dall'Oglio from University of Rome performed the first scientific experience towards a site qualification at Dome C.

In 1996, a French-Italian team established a summer camp at Dome C. The two main objectives of the camp were the provision of logistical support for the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) and the construction of a permanent research station.

The new all-year facility, Concordia Station, became operational in 2005. The first winterover began with a staff of 13 (eleven French and 2 Italians) in February 2005.

Access 

Most of the cargo is moved to Dome C by traverse from Dumont d'Urville Station, covering 1,200 km in 7 to 12 days depending on weather conditions. Station personnel and light cargo arrive by air, using Twin Otter aircraft from DDU or Mario Zucchelli Station at 1200 km.

M. n. Silanus was consul in 25 BC with Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, the emperor Augustus.

Biography
Silanus was a descendant of the noble Roman house of the Junii Silani. He was probably the son of Decimus Junius Silanus, consul in 62 BC, (thus the grandson of Marcus Junius Silanus, consul in 109 BC.) and Servilia, mistress of Julius Caesar, (thus the half brother of Brutus the Younger, full brother of Junia Prima, Junia Secunda and Junia Tertia and the brother-in-law of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, the triumvir, trought Secunda.

Silanus served as one of Julius Caesar's legates in 53 BC.  He supported his brother-in-law Lepidus in 44 BC after Caesar's murder, accompanying Lepidus over the Alps.  The following year, Lepidus sent him with a detachment of troops to join Marcus Antonius at Mutina, but refused to accept responsibility for the help which Silanus gave.  After falling out of favor with the triumvirs, in 39 he fled to Sextus Pompeius.  He was able to return to Antonius's service under the terms of the Pact of Misenum.  Silanus later served under Antonius in Greece and Macedonia from 34 to 32, with the title of Quaestor pro consule or perhaps Proquaestor.  Around this time he was also elected as an Augur.

Before the Battle of Actium, Silanus went over to Octavianus.  The future emperor raised him to the Patriciate in 30 BC, and they held the consulship together in 25.

Silanus' grandson, Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, was consul in AD 19, and married a great-granddaughter of Augustus.

The Great","The Great Railway Bazaar: By Train Through Asia is a travelogue by American novelist Paul Theroux, first published in 1975. It recounts Theroux's four-month journey by train in 1973 from London through Europe, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, and his return via the Trans-Siberian Railway. The first part of the route, to India, followed what was then known as the hippie trail.  It is widely regarded as a classic in the genre of travel writing.  It sold 1.5 million copies upon release.

In the book, Theroux explored themes such as colonialism, American imperialism, poverty, and ignorance. These were embedded in his accounts of sights and sounds he experienced as well as his conversation with other people such as his fellow travelers. It included elements of fiction such as descriptions of places, situations, and people, reflecting the author's own thoughts and outlook. Contemporaneous reviews noted how his background allowed him the breadth of insights to authoritatively describe people even when there are instances when he committed ethnic generalizations. Prior to the publication of The Great Railway Bazaar, Theroux lived in Africa, Singapore, and England.

In a 2013 article, Theroux outlined several inspirations that led him to embark on his journey and publish his experiences. These include his fascination for trains, which offered what he described as an opportunity to break monotony as well as a respite from work. He wrote:I could think clearly on the London trains and when, on the rare occasions, I travelled out of London – on the Exeter line via Sherborne, Yeovil, and Crewkerne, to visit my in‑laws, or on the Flying Scotsman on a journalistic assignment, my spirits revived and I saw with clarity that it might be possible to conceive a book based on a long railway journey.

It is based on the fighting game of the same name and its subsequent iterations. The manga was produced prior to the release of Super Street Fighter II and only features the original twelve ""World Warriors"".

While far from being the only Street Fighter manga, it was one of the earliest and the first of few that was translated in English. It is notable for featuring the first illustrated appearance of Ryu and Ken's sensei, Gouken.

Plot summary
Ryu and Ken have begun training with the reluctant and mysterious legend Gouken. One night, Ken's friend Cho appears at the dojo in a panic, revealing that he has learned of M. Bison's organization, Shadaloo, and its current agenda—vicious human experiments revolving around a drug called Doll which effectively brainwashes people, usually for acts of violence. Cho has been followed and falls victim to an attack by Bison and two of his lords of Shadaloo, Vega and Sagat. Naturally, a fight ensues, during which the groups of combatants become separated. After making his way back to the dojo, Ryu finds that Gouken has been left for dead by Bison, and hears his master's final words. Assuming the missing Ken to be dead also, Ryu becomes a lonesome vagabond.

Years later, Doll has had an effect on the lives of a soldier named Guile and an Interpol officer named Chun-Li who have arrived on Shad and entered its martial-arts tournament in respective efforts to investigate Shadaloo and reach Bison, who has become the tournament's champion. Ryu, now a more capable fighter, has also emerged on Shad and entered the tournament, while befriending Cho's old girlfriend Po-Lin and her little brother Wong-Mei, who have been recently orphaned and manage their family's Chinese restaurant.

The VX800 was designed at U.S. Suzuki's Design Studio in Brea, California from 1986 to 1989, and produced in the years 1990 to 1997.  Lackluster sales in the United States brought the model to an end in 1993, the European version was produced until 1997.

Concept and prototype

Among others, the design team consisted of
Don Presnell, Lead Designer-styling, 
Aki Goto as Lead Engineer and 
Sam Yamazaki for frame and engine engineering.

Sam Yamazaki and Aki Goto were the inspired R&D engineers who started putting together a crude prototype at the Brea Studio utilizing a 750 cc Intruder engine in a modified Intruder frame. The rake and trail were modified on that prototype, as were the footpeg/shifter positions. The prototype was finished off with a hand-hammered aluminum tank mastered by Sam Yamazaki.
The first full scale clay modeling of the VX750 was done by Don Presnell at the Brea facility.
A quote by Don Presnell on the changes made in Japan on the concept.
""The original full-scale clay model that I accompanied over to Japan had a rear fender/seat more like the first sketch. It's true that Japanese management did want to play it safe, so they went with the more traditional styling on the rear fender. Many times a transportation Designer's sketches/models get compromised when it gets to the Marketing Dept. stage!""
The suspension, engine work and final touches on the frame were done in Hammamatsu, Japan, once the concept & design direction were established, at this point it was out of the hands of the U.S. development team.

Variations
There were four variations of the VX800:
the Japanese version featured a slightly shorter frame.
the European version was equipped with the pre-production 75-degree crank pin offset for smoother operation at high engine speeds.

The pilot film first aired on May 4, 1975 and the series itself premiered September 8, 1975; the last episode aired January 9, 1976.

Barbary Coast was inspired by a similar 19th-century spy series, The Wild Wild West, and like the earlier program, Barbary Coast mixed the genres of Western and secret agent drama.

Synopsis

Barbary Coast features the adventures of 19th century government agent Jeff Cable (played by William Shatner), and his pal, conman and gambler Cash (""Cash makes no enemies"") Conover (Doug McClure; played by Dennis Cole in the pilot) who is the owner of the Golden Gate Casino. This was Shatner's first attempt at a live-action series since Star Trek (also produced by Paramount Television).

In their battle against various criminals and foreign spies, Cable and Conover operated out of the latter's saloon and casino located on San Francisco's notorious Barbary Coast. Like Wild Wild West's Artemus Gordon, Cable frequently donned disguises in the course of his investigations.

The producers modeled the show's Byzantine plotlines/conspiracies on the Mission: Impossible paradigm (in fact, they hired a number of Mission: Impossible's writers). Other regulars on the series included recurring Wild Wild West villain actor Richard Kiel as Moose Moran and Dave Turner as Thumbs.

Episodes

Home media
The series was released on DVD and Blu-ray in June 2014.

Awards and nominations
The pilot episode, an ABC Sunday Night Movie, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Art Direction for Jack De Shields and set decorator Reg Allen.

The Mad Magazine Star Trek musical satire ""Keep on Trekkin'"" (1976) depicts William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk on the bridge of the U.S.S. Enterprise singing a version of Send in the Clowns that includes the lyric ""Look at me now/At my old post/Happy that I can forget Barbary Coast!""

They were first mentioned in writing by Charles Henry Tyler Townsend in 1893. The name Leptoconops carteri is a junior synonym of L. torrens. They are prevalent in the southwestern and southeastern areas of the United States. In early stages of life, L. torrens flies dwell in soil, then emerges to feed and breed as fully developed adults.

L. torrens females rely on blood meals from vertebrates for nutrition, while males feed on various plant products such as nectar. L. torrens infestations in California have caused people to take measures to control their populations. The flies are relatively small at around  long and are difficult to spot, making preventing L. torrens bites difficult. Construction projects and farming efforts have been temporarily suspended because of L. torrens biting activity.

Description

Larvae
L. torrens larvae have 21 body segments and are  long on average. The larva has a transparent body, and mouthparts are visible through the head. These mandibles are heavily chitinized, which differs from those of other species. The antenna retracts into the head with additional chitinized parts, and no eye organs are visible. Male and female larvae are indistinguishable by size.

Adults
Adults are close in appearance to the Bodega black gnat. Adult flies are about  long and are black in color. Female flies have 14 antennae segments. The females have relatively stout abdomens, and have no hairs around their eye area. Males also lack hair on the face.

Distribution

The species can be found from California to Utah, New Mexico, Texas, Mexico, and southeast Florida as well as the Caribbean. They have also been observed in Colorado and Nevada. Their emergences have typically been observed and recorded in California.

Habitat

Barentsøya is an Arctic island. Around 43 per cent of its area of  is glaciated. To the north, in the sound between Barentsøya and Spitsbergen, lies the island of Kükenthaløya. To the south, the sound separating Barents Island from Edgeøya is Freemansundet.

In geologic time much of the surface rock has been eroded by glaciation. The entire area is visited by polar bears, who have a recognisable genetic differentiation specialised to the Barents Sea region. At Dørstubukta there is also a large nesting mainly used by kittiwakes.

Geography

Barentsøya has an approximately square shape, with maximum lengths and widths of about fifty kilometers, and an area of . A significant part of the island, more than , is glaciated. The ice cap of Barentsjøkulen covers a large part of the island, with the largest offspring Besselsbreen (north), Duckwitzbreen (west), Freemanbreen (south), and Hübnerbreen (southeast). Barentsjøkulen has the two large ice domes of Peer Gyntslottet and Solveigdomen. The mountain of Schweinfurthberget is a nunatak of Barentsjøkulen.

At the northern side of Barentsøya is the ice-free peninsula of Frankenhalvøya, between Ginevra Bay at the western side and Dorstbukta to the east. Grimheia is an ice-free mountainous area extending over a length of about thirteen kilometers at the northern part of the island. The westernmost point of the island is the headland of Mistakodden. At the southern part of Barentsøya are the mountains of Krefftberget and Høgrinden, while Jeppeberget is located to the southeast.

The area was developed in the early 1900s as a resort with a hotel and incline railway. The mountains are still a good spot for hiking, snowshoeing, and scenic views of the nearby skyline of Manchester and even, on a clear day, the faint skyline of Boston.

They were the site of a small ski operation in the 1930s and 1940s, served by the incline railway that went up the south peak. With three main trails from top to bottom, it was a popular ski destination until 1941, when the railway was damaged by a fire.

A new development was planned in the 1960s for the north peak, commencing in 1963. Chairlift and snow making equipment was ordered, several trails were cleared, but the project was halted by the town of Goffstown because of environmental concerns. In response to the failure, the city of Manchester opened its own area, McIntyre, in 1971.

The south peak contains transmitting facilities for many of the broadcast stations serving the Manchester area.

Description
The wingspan is 40–48 mm for males and 40–52 mm for females. The upperside of the wings of males is pure white with a narrow black forewing tip and small black dots on the hindwing margin. The underside is whitish with two rows of black spots on the hindwings, with the inner row sometimes absent or incomplete. The female has several colour forms, but is usually pale yellowish white on the uppersurface with heavier black markings than the male, and has a dark spot on each forewing. There is a rare female form (luteola) where the upperside is orange yellow or deep apricot. The underside of females is similar to the male but the rows of black dots are more pronounced and the base colour is pale to bright yellow. Another rare form (rubrobasalis) has orange suffusion at the base of the underside of the forewing and a creamy-yellow upperside. The dry-season form (alba) has reduced black markings. A distinguishing feature of D. pigea is that the hindwing costal has a yellow streak, unlike other Dixeia species.

Distribution
This species is found from the Eastern Cape province of South Africa through KwaZulu-Natal, Swaziland, Mpumalanga and Limpopo Province, to Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, DRC, Angola and Cameroon.

His 15-year career was mainly associated with Racing de Santander, and he also represented five other teams, mostly in the lower leagues. As a manager, he also coached with his main club but worked mostly with Sporting de Gijón, promoting to La Liga in 2008.

Preciado died in June 2012 at the age of 54, from a heart attack.

Playing career
Born in El Astillero, Cantabria, Preciado appeared in 59 La Liga matches for local Racing de Santander, split between three of his five-year spell with the club. His best-ever in the top flight was 32 games in the 1978–79 season, which ended in relegation.

After three years in Segunda División (two of them with Linares CF), Preciado resumed his career in the lower leagues, eventually retiring in 1992 with lowly Gimnástica de Torrelavega, also in his native region, at nearly 35. He scored his first and only goal in the top level on 18 April 1982, but in a 1–4 away loss against Athletic Bilbao.

Coaching career
Preciado took up coaching in the mid-90s precisely with his last club, leading it to the Tercera División championship. Being then recalled by Racing to be in charge of the reserves, another promotion to Segunda División B befell, now in 2002.

Preciado was called for first-team coaching duties in 2002–03's top flight, helping them retain their status in his 18 games in charge. After second division spells with Levante UD – with promotion– and Real Murcia, he returned to Santander; although the side finished just one point above the relegation zone, they managed a 2–1 win over Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on 21 December 2005.

In the summer of 2006, Preciado switched to Sporting de Gijón.

Lyrics and music
The first song to take place once Quadrophenia'''s narrative moves to Brighton, ""Sea and Sand"" portrays opera protagonist Jimmy's affinity for the beach as an escape from the unpleasant realities of home and life, as well as his memories from past mod gatherings at Brighton. With singing by both Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend, slow dreamy parts and fast angry parts, and a coda that reprises the early Who single ""I'm the Face"", ""Sea and Sand"" is almost a mini-opera unto itself, and is one of the album's most characteristic tracks. It is one of four songs on the album to reference the mod movement.

""Sea and Sand"" also marks a point of reflection in the narrative. After the protagonist leaves home, he is left on the beach. He reflects about his inadequacy in love and inability to fit in at home or with the other tickets and faces within the Mod subculture. The song also speaks to Townshend's growing alienation from his band and the music scene as a whole. As such, it serves as a telling sign of the years to come and the state of the Who during and directly after this period.

Reception
While not released as a single, the song gained significant airplay on progressive rock radio; Richard Neer of WNEW-FM in New York labeled it the album's best. ""Sea and Sand"" remains a fan favourite, and the line ""Here by the sea and sand/Nothing ever goes as planned"" is a well-remembered Who lyric. Indeed following The Who's 1996 performances of Quadrophenia at Madison Square Garden, fans sung that and other lines from the song as they were leaving the arena.

Covers
The song was memorably treated by keyboardist Page McConnell of the jam band Phish in their 1995 concert album, Phish: New Year's Eve 1995 - Live at Madison Square Garden.

Formation
The band was founded in Brighton in 2004 by Ross Clifford, Simon Myers, Phil Boucherat, Steve Cartwright and The Damned's Monty Oxymoron. They made their debut at the Marlborough Theatre, Brighton, for The Real Music Club during the middle of 2004. The band have experimented and undergone many line-up changes. Myers left in 2006 and was replaced by Marc Jenner. Shortly after, the band expanded their line-up, recruiting Andy Baynton-Power (bass), Eva Thompson (sitar), Mickey Wynne (guitars) and Stuart McKay (harmonicas) along with occasional appearances from The Hobbit (accordion). Boucherat and Thompson left during 2007. The following year, Cliff Dowding joined on synthesizers, noises and lighting. In 2009, Jenner left the band due to ill health and was replaced by Richard Lanchester. The Hobbit moved away in 2009 while Clifford and Wynne left the band in 2010 to pursue separate creative interests. They were replaced by Tony Green (formerly of the cult band The Unbelievables) on vocals and Trevor Nobes (TNT and others) on guitars. After many artistic differences, Lanchester left the band in 2014 and was replaced by Dave Berk, the founder of Johnny Moped. However due to the recent revival of the Johnny Moped band, Berk was no longer able to commit to the Kyngs and subsequently left in 2015. He was replaced in 2015 by Graham Durrant, who was with Indie band 14 Iced Bears.

Early life
Johnson was born in Syracuse, New York, on March 27, 1841.  He attended the local schools, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1862.  While establishing himself as a lawyer, Johnson served on the Syracuse Board of School Commissioners in 1862 and 1863.

In 1863, Johnson was accused of falsifying endorsements on promissory notes worth $250 each.  Unable to pay the debt, he hastily departed for Arizona Territory to accept a job arranged by his brother as a quartermaster's clerk for the Union Army.Arizona Territory.  He held this position until the end of the American Civil War in April 1865, when he relocated to California.

Move to California
Johnson moved to California in 1865, and established himself in Sacramento, where he built a successful law practice, sold insurance, and became involved in other business ventures.  He was able to satisfy his past debts, and the charges against him in Syracuse were dismissed.

In addition to his legal and business activities, Johnson became involved in local government and politics as a Republican.

","Filippo Raguzzini (19 July 1690 – 21 February 1771) was an Italian architect best known for a range of buildings constructed during the reign of Benedict XIII.

Biography
Raguzzini was born in Naples into a family of stonemasons.  Little is known of his early history, but he was called to Benevento in the wake of the earthquake of 1702, which caused widespread destruction in the city.  In Benevento, he came to the attention of Pietro Francesco Orsini, the then archbishop of Benevento for 38 years, who in 1724 became Benedict XIII.  This encounter with Orsini would be of crucial significance for Raguzzini's later career.  There is considerable scholarly debate about which works in Benevento should be attributed to Raguzzini's early period, but the chapel of San Gennaro in the church of the Annunziata (1710) is thought to be his work.  Two later churches, San Filippo (1724–27) and San Bartolomeo (consecrated in 1729) in Benevento, are attributed to Raguzzini from the period after Benedict XIII's election.

Once Benedict XIII was elected, Raguzzini moved to Rome and commenced a meteoric rise to the top of the papal architectural establishment. Official honours were lavished on him from as early as 1725, when he was made a Knight of the Golden Spur; in February 1727, he was elected an accademico di merito of the Accademia di San Luca.  The pope's patronage saw Raguzzini ultimately serve in almost every major public architectural office in the city.  The most significant posts he held were those in which he supplanted the much older and highly respected Roman architect, Alessandro Specchi, whose most important work, the Porto di Ripetta, had been executed in the reign of Clement XI:  these roles were those of the architect of the popolo romano (essentially the city architect), the architect of the Tribunale delle acque e strade and the architect of the Sacri Palazzi Apostolici. Raguzzini held these offices from 1728, although they were nominally to be ",0,Filippo Raguzzini (19 July,Filippo Raguzzini (19 July,10,1.4b

In his old age Mentor was a friend of Odysseus. When Odysseus left for the Trojan War, he placed Mentor and Eumaeus (Odysseus' foster-brother) in charge of his son Telemachus, and of Odysseus' palace.

When Athena visited Telemachus, she took the disguise of Mentor to hide herself from the suitors of Telemachus's mother Penelope. As Mentor, the goddess encouraged Telemachus to stand up against the suitors and go abroad to find out what happened to his father. When Odysseus returned to Ithaca, Athena appeared briefly in the form of Mentor again at Odysseus' palace. 

Athena's appearance as Mentor should not be confused with her appearance as Mentes in the first book of the Odyssey.

Mentor as term

Because of Mentor's relationship with Telemachus, and the disguised Athena's encouragement and practical plans for dealing with personal dilemmas, the personal name Mentor has been adopted in Latin and other languages, including English, as a term meaning someone who imparts wisdom to and shares knowledge with a less-experienced colleague.

The first recorded modern usage of the term can be traced to a 1699 book entitled Les Aventures de Télémaque, by the French writer François Fénelon In the book the lead character is that of Mentor. This book was very popular during the 18th century and the modern application of the term can be traced to this publication.

Built by the Canterbury Provincial government to the broad gauge of , the railway reached most of the Canterbury region by the time the province was abolished in 1876. Edward Dobson, the Provincial Engineer from 1854 to 1868, was the designer and overseer.

History
New Zealand's first public railway was opened from Christchurch to Ferrymead in 1863. In 1867 the Ferrymead  section was made redundant when the line through the Lyttelton rail tunnel to the port of Lyttelton opened. The contractors who had built the line operated the trains until 31 July 1868, when the Canterbury Provincial Railways took direct control.

The Canterbury Provincial Railways built two lines into rural areas along the east coast, the Main South Line to Timaru and eventually Dunedin, and the Main North Line towards Marlborough. Both lines were built as broad gauge, as far as Rakaia on the Main South Line, reached in June 1873, and Amberley 50 km north of Christchurch, on the Main North Line.

By the time the provinces were abolished and the Provincial Railways absorbed into the national network, the Canterbury network had been converted from broad gauge to narrow gauge ().

Motive power

The Canterbury Provincial Railways operated ten steam locomotives of varying types, not divided into separate classes.  They were all tank locomotives based on contemporary British practice and were built by the Avonside Engine Company, except for no. 9 by Neilson and Company.  Nos. 1-4 had a 2-4-0T wheel arrangement: 1 was built for the Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company of Australia in 1862 but was quickly on-sold to the contractors building the Ferrymead line, and it entered revenue service when the line opened; 2 arrived in April 1864, 3 in March 1867 and 4 in May 1868.

Ewiniar is responsible for at least 181 deaths. However, an unofficial report stated that up to 10,000 people had been killed by flooding in North Korea, with 4,000 people missing.

Meteorological history 

On June 29, a persistent tropical disturbance was classified as a tropical depression by the JTWC while east of Palau. The depression moved northwestward and was upgraded to Tropical Storm 04W by the JTWC the next day on June 30, while the JMA named the storm Tropical Storm Ewiniar at around the same time. The name ""Ewiniar"" was submitted by the Federated States of Micronesia, and refers to a traditional storm god of Chuuk.

Ewiniar moved west-northwestward over the next two days, bringing heavy rain and localized flooding to the Yap Islands. Ewiniar turned to the northwest and reached its peak intensity of 130 knots (240 km/h or 150 mph) on the U.S. method of measuring windspeeds by one-minute averages, or 100 knots (185 km/h or 115 mph) on the international method of measuring windspeeds by ten-minute averages, and its minimum pressure of 930 hPa (mbar). Ewiniar turned northward and brushed eastern China, forcing evacuations in many cities.

Ewiniar gradually weakened as it moved over colder waters, and made landfall in South Korea on July 10 as a severe tropical storm, having briefly threatened to make landfall on impoverished North Korea. Ewiniar passed within  of Seoul as it moved across the country before becoming extratropical over the Sea of Japan the next day.

The Merle Reskin Theatre is now part of DePaul University, and is also used for events and performances of other groups. It serves as the home of the Chicago Playworks for Families and Young Audiences series produced by The Theatre School of DePaul.

The building was designed by Marshall and Fox and developed by Tracy C. Drake and John Drake of Drake Hotel fame on the former site of Timothy Blackstone's mansion.  The theatre has a rich history of live performances that have traditionally been touring productions of hit and prize-winning shows.

Building
The architects who designed the new theatre in 1910 were Benjamin Marshall and Charles Fox of the firm Marshall and Fox, who also designed the adjacent Blackstone Hotel in 1909. As with the hotel, the theatre took its name from Timothy Blackstone, whose mansion had previously occupied the site.  The original address was on Hubbard Court, which was later renamed Seventh Street, and renamed once again to East Balbo Drive, the current name. The building is six stories tall and built in a French Renaissance style.  Constructed only seven years after the Iroquois Theater Fire, the theater was required to be fireproof and the management claimed the auditorium could be cleared in three minutes.  Seating capacity was 1,400 people until 1988, when renovations to reinstate the orchestra pit and to create seating for handicapped persons reduced the seat count to 1,325.

The developers of both the Blackstone Hotel and Blackstone Theatre were Tracy C. Drake and John Drake, better known as developers and proprietors of the Drake Hotel.

Clementine was designed and built in 1945–1946 and first achieved criticality in 1946 and full power in 1949. The reactor was named after the song ""Oh My Darling, Clementine.""  The similarities to the song were that the reactor was located in a deep canyon and the reactor operators were 49'ers, as 49 (last digits of element 94, isotope 239) was one of the code names for plutonium at the time.

The primary goal of Clementine was to determine nuclear properties of materials for nuclear weapons research after the Manhattan project.  A number of other experiments were performed at the reactor, including investigation of the feasibility of civilian breeder reactors, and measuring neutron cross sections of various materials.

Core design
The core was contained in a  long mild steel cylinder that had an inside diameter of  and a wall   thick.  The fuel assembly was  in diameter   tall and contained 55 fuel elements.  Each fuel element was composed of δ-phase plutonium-239.  They were each  diameter and   long.  The fuel elements were clad in   thick plain carbon steel.  The core was located at the bottom of the steel cylinder.

The Battle of G","The Battle of Gully Ravine (Zığındere) was a World War I battle fought at Cape Helles on the Gallipoli peninsula. By June 1915 all thoughts the Allies had of a swift decisive victory over the Ottoman Empire had vanished. The preceding Third Battle of Krithia and the attack at Gully Ravine had limited objectives and had much in common with the trench warfare prevailing on the Western Front. Unlike previous Allied attacks at Helles, the Gully Ravine action was largely successful at achieving its objectives though at a typically high cost in casualties.

Prelude

The third battle of Krithia on 4 June had made some progress in the centre of the line at Helles but had failed on the left flank (west) along Gully Spur and Gully Ravine and on the right flank (east) where the French contingent were confronted by a number of strong Ottoman redoubts on Kereves Spur. As a prelude to a new offensive the commander at Helles, Lieutenant General Aylmer Hunter-Weston ordered separate limited attacks to advance the flanks.

(1. Kerevizdere Battle)On 21 June the French, with overwhelming artillery support, attacked two redoubts controlling the crest of Kereves Spur (Kervizdere). Over 40,000 shells fell on the Ottoman 2nd Division defending this area.   They succeeded in capturing Haricot Redoubt but the second objective, the Quadrilateral, was not captured until 30 June. Captain Kemal Bey commanding the troops from the line of fire was wounded and died the next day. The French suffered 2,500 casualties but the Ottomans on the receiving end of the bombardment suffered 6,000. Remnants of the Ottoman 2nd Division were pulled back to the Asian side after this battle. This minor gain was cause of much celebration for allies who were at that point very anxious for any good news.  General Gourard received congratulatory telegrams from London and Paris, Lord Kitchener, Admiral Robeck, and General Hamilton.  Colonel Girdon was awarded the Légion d'honneur.

History

Origins of the clan

The name Boyd is said to be descriptive, being derived from the Scottish Gaelic buidh which means fair or yellow. The progenitor is said to have been Robert, son of Simon and nephew of Walter fitz Alan, the first High Steward of Scotland. This theory however is challenged by genealogist, William Anderson, who points out that most of the friends and dependents of the High Stewards were of Norman origin and it is therefore unlikely that they would use a Celtic nickname for one of their own family. Anderson believed the name to be of either Norman or Saxon origin. The historian, George Fraser Black, asserts that the first Boyds were vassals of a Norman family, the de Morvilles, for their lands around Largs and Irvine. Black also states that the surname Boyd may be derived from the Scottish Gaelic for the Isle of Bute which is Bòd. Black gives an example of the Marquess of Bute in Scottish Gaelic being Morair Bhoid. Modern sources give the Isle of Bute in Scottish Gaelic as Eilean Bhòid.

In 1205 Robert de Boyd (or Robertus de Boyd) witnessed a contract between the Lord of Eglinton and the burgh of Irvine. Robert de Boyte is listed on the Ragman Rolls, giving homage to Edward I of England in 1296.

Wars of Scottish Independence

In 1306 Duncan Boyd was executed for supporting the cause of Scottish Independence. Also during the Wars of Scottish Independence, Sir Robert Boyd was a strong supporter of King Robert the Bruce and was even one of the commanders at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. He was rewarded for his gallantry, with lands that had been confiscated off the Balliols, including Kilmarnock, Bodington and other substantial lands in Ayrshire.

Geography
According to the United States Census Bureau, the land area of the village of Lake Barrine is the second-largest in the state of New Jersey. The village is located in the eastern part of the state of New Jersey, USA.

Demographics

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,968 people","Lake Barrine is a rural locality in the Tablelands Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , Lake Barrine had a population of 152 people.

Geography 
The locality is on the Atherton Tableland. It takes its name from the lake of the same name in the west of the locality, which in turn comes from the Aboriginal word ""barrang"", meaning big water. The lake and surrounding area is part of the Crater Lakes National Park. The rest of the locality is used for farming.

History 
In the 1880s, there was logging of the rainforest timbers. However, concern about the potential loss of large kauri and cedar pines near the lake led to the establishment of a scenic reserve in 1888 to protect the trees. In 1920, George and Margaret Curry established a tourism business with lake cruises and a tea house. The completion of the Cairns Range Road (now known as the Gillies Highway) from Gordonvale to Atherton in 1926 provided much better access to the area for tourists. In 1934, the Queensland Government created the Lake Barrine National Park.

The Lakebank State School opened on 18 July 1922. In 1936 it was renamed Lake Barrine State School. It closed  on 30 June 1949.

During World War II, air raids on Australian towns by Japan and the fear of an invasion by the Japanese led to evacuations from northern Australian towns. In March 1942, the students of St Augustine's College in Cairns were evacuated to the guest house at Lake Barrine. In late 1942, Lieutenant General Thomas Blamey decided to establish army facilities on the Atherton Tableland for the recuperation and training of troops returning from the Middle East to defend Australia against the Japanese. With 40,000 troops on the Atherton Tableland, Lake Barrine became an important recreational facility and the guest house was used by the 2/1 Australian Army Convalescent Depot. After the war ended, the Curry family resumed their tourist business at the lake.

Steve","Retired Boxer is the seventh self-released music cassette album by singer-songwriter Daniel Johnston, recorded in 1984. His song ""True Love Will Find You in the End"" has become one of his best-known songs, covered by many other artists, beginning with The Reivers in 1987 (and later included on the 2002 reissue of their album Saturday).  Beck recorded a cover of the song  which appeared on the Daniel Johnston tribute album, The Late Great Daniel Johnston: Discovered Covered. Wilco also recorded a version of this song as a B-Side to their 1999 song ""A Shot In The Arm"".  Basia Bulat has performed the song frequently in concert.  Matthew Good recorded a version of the same song for his 2007 album Hospital Music, as well as Mates of State on their 2010 album Crushes (The Covers Mixtape). The song was also used in a 2012 commercial for a men's hair care product.

The nine songs on the album are done in Daniel's confessional piano ballad style that had been exemplified on his eight previous cassette albums. This album, like those before it was recorded with a consumer grade tape player. Evidence of this is found in the warbling tape hiss and distortion along with Daniel's pitched up voice, all of which are easily recognizable traits of lo-fidelity recordings.

Category","Stylidium semipartitum is a dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the genus Stylidium (family Stylidiaceae). It is an herbaceous annual or perennial that grows from 9 to 40 cm tall. Oblanceolate, elliptical, or obovate leaves, about 10-30 per plant, form a terminal rosette with stems present and glandular-hairy. The glandular-hairy leaves are generally 11–68 mm long and 3–21 mm wide. This species produces 1-18 scapes per plant. Inflorescences are 8–30 cm long and produce pink, mauve, or red flowers that bloom from March to August in their native range. S. semipartitum is endemic to the Kimberley region of Western Australia and northern parts of the Northern Territory. Its typical habitat has been reported as either damp sandy soils in eucalypt woodlands, near creeks in the company of Melaleuca species or on sandstone plateaux with Triodia species. S. semipartitum is distinct within section Debilia because it possesses glandular-hairy leaves. Other than that distinctive feature, however, it resembles descriptions of S. leptorrhizum, which is why George Bentham reduced S. semipartitum to a synonym of S. leptorrhizum.

He was educated at the University of","Michael Joseph ""King"" Kelly (December 31, 1857 – November 8, 1894), also commonly known as ""$10,000 Kelly"", was an American outfielder, catcher, and manager in various professional American baseball leagues including the National League, International Association, Players' League, and the American Association. He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career with the Chicago White Stockings and the Boston Beaneaters. Kelly was a player-manager three times in his career – in 1887 for the Beaneaters, in 1890 leading the Boston Reds to the pennant in the only season of the Players' League's existence, and in 1891 for the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers – before his retirement in 1893. He is also often credited with helping to popularize various strategies as a player such as the hit and run, the hook slide, and the catcher's practice of backing up first base.

In only the second vote since its creation in 1939, the Old Timers Committee (now the Veterans' Committee) elected Kelly to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945.

In concluding where to truly give Kelly credit as an innovator, a 2004 book devoted to 19th-century rule bending in baseball—and which came close to exhaustively accounting for all contemporary reporting on various subjects—placed stress on the following: ""Kelly's hook slide does sound special, and players probably tried to copy it.  Also, he seems to have been the first big leaguer to successfully cut a base (when the usually lone umpire wasn't looking), at least according to the newspaper record.""  And, ""Kelly could have been the first to foul off lots of pitches on purpose.  Doing so was a top trick of some Baltimore players of the 1890s.  At the turn of the century, that trick was defused when all foul balls began counting as strikes.""

Following his public criticism of the Camp David Accords, he was dismissed from his post as Ambassador to Britain and Portugal, then he went to Algeria as a political refugee.

He is credited with the equipping and preparation of the Egyptian Armed Forces in the years prior to the successful capture of the Israeli Bar-Lev line at the start of the 1973 war. He was dismissed from his post on Dec 13 1973.

Six-Day War (1967) 
During the Six-Day War, Shazly showed great merit and tactical awareness. He was positioned in the middle of Sinai with a mixed unit of one infantry battalion, two Sa'ka(Thunderbolt) battalions, and one tank battalion. Following the initial air raid and subsequent superiority of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), the Egyptian command had given a chaotic order for all of its troops to retreat westward which would cause most of them to be mopped by the IAF, especially after most communications were lost between the troops and the Egyptian command; Shazly, however, took the most unbelievable of chances and headed eastward through thin passages, invading Israel itself. He eventually positioned himself in the Negev desert, behind most enemy lines. This feat would have made him one of the few Arab generals to ever successfully take and hold territory inside Israel.

He stayed there with his battalions under the cover of two mountains to avoid IAF bombing for two days, the 6th and 7th of June. Finally, he succeeded in making contact with the Egyptian command which ordered him to immediately retreat west of the Suez Canal. He responded with one of the most difficult maneuvers executed in the history of the Egyptian–Israeli conflict, a night march (with mechanized units and tanks accompanying) in the desert and through enemy lines. His unit managed to cover about 60 miles of ground th",0,Saad Mohamed el-Husseiny,Saad Mohamed el-Husseiny,10,1.4b

Although a junior employee of the hotel initially contacted about the matter by the Hindustan Times stated that the booking was cancelled for ""gender-based reasons"", this was later denied by the general manager who stated the ""allegations of discrimination of any kind were false"" and that the hotel had not yet confirmed Joshi's booking because it was still waiting for approval from the regional sales office.

His Life 

Josef Speckbacher was born on July 13, 1767 in Gnadenwald, near Hall, in Austria's Tyrolean Alps. He was a peasant’s son, for Speckbacher’s father supplied wood for the salt mines of Hall for a living. Receiving only a brief education, Josef roamed the woods, poaching by the age of twelve, which got him into trouble with the forest officials. Josef got a job working in the Imperial salt mine in Hall. This work allowed him to start a family of his own.

On February 10, 1794, 27-year-old Speckbacher married Mary Schmiederer, and relocated to her farm in Judenstein, Rinn. From that time on, he had the nickname “the Man from Rinn.” He was respected by his community, and in 1796, during a politically sensitive time, he was elected to the local court committee.

France and Austria were at war, though, so he enlisted as a volunteer militiaman. On April 2, 1797 at the Battle of Spinges (in the town Spinges, near Brixen), Speckbacher fought in the ranks of Captain Philip von Wörndle beside Catherine Lanz, the heroine of Spinges, earning a reputation as a zealous sharpshooter. He continued the defense against Napoleon’s Marshal Ney until 1805, when the French were victorious. The Austrian Tyrol was obliged to accept being ceded to Napoleon’s ally, Bavaria.

By 1809, the Austrian government sought to recapture the Tyrol through guerrilla tactics. Speckbacher showed himself to be not only a daring fighter, but also a cautious but fearless strategist.  According to his diary, he took part in thirty-six battles and skirmishes in 1809 alone. Early in the morning of April 12, 1809, he surprised the city of Hall, imprisoned the garrison troops and prevented the French retreat into the safety of the valley of the lower Inn.

Continuity
Although a sequel to New Ghoul @ School, Fright On! is more in line with the regular webisodes. It takes place supposedly in Volume 2, while New Ghoul @ School is in Volume 1.

Plot
At the Maul, the ghouls and the turtles are waiting for the new Twiheart movie. They learn about the feud between vampires and werewolves after hearing them whispers amongst themselves after seeing Draculaura and Clawd holding hands together. However, it turns out they were just pointing out the toilet paper stuck to Draculaura's boot.

At school later on, the ghouls get caught in the excitement of an announcement. Headmistress Bloodgood said that she was merging Monster High with two other schools. Belfry Prep is an all-vampire school while Crescent Moon High is exclusively for werewolves. She hopes to eventually unite all monsters and then eventually even the human community. While this unnerved Draculaura and Clawdeen greatly, Frankie saw this as an opportunity to unite the two backgrounds, especially after the Fear Squad was placed as welcoming committee. With a little help from Abbey, the ghouls made a killer set-up, only to have it ruined after the two schools arrive. Bram Devein and Gory Fangtell, two snobby vampires, and Dougey, a brawny werewolf, are introduced after the three pass snarky comments to one another, after which Romulus, Clawd's childhood friend, tells the werewolves to not cause trouble on their first day at their new school.

The first day is an initial disaster.

Historic sites are usually protected by law, and many have been recognized with the official national historic site status. A historic site may be any building, landscape, site or structure that is of local, regional, or national significance.

Historic site visitors
Historic sites and heritage sites are often maintained for members of the public to be able to visit. Visitors may come out of a sense of nostalgia for bygone eras, out of wishing to learn about their cultural heritage, or general interest in learning about the historical context of the site. Many sites offer guided tours for visitors, conducted by site staff who have been trained to offer an interpretation of life at the time the site represents. A site may also have a visitor center with more modern architecture and facilities, which serves as a gateway between the outside world and the historic site, and allows visitors to learn some of the historical aspects of the site without excessively exposing locations that may require delicate treatment.

Stilling (11 February 1810","Benedikt Stilling (11 February 1810 – 28 January 1879) was a German anatomist and surgeon who was a native of Kirchhain. He was the father of German ophthalmologist Jakob Stilling (1842–1915).

In 1832 he received his doctorate from the University of Marburg. Later he had a private practice in Kassel, and travelled extensively throughout Europe, particularly Paris, where he collaborated with physicians that included Claude Bernard (1813–1873), Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) and Jean Zuléma Amussat (1796–1856).

Stilling made important contributions in the field of neurology. He performed research involving the structure of the cerebellum, as well as histological studies of the pons. In 1840 he made first mention of vasomotor nerves in a treatise titled Physiologisch-pathologische und medicinisch-praktische Untersuchungen über die Spinal-Irritation. Also, he is remembered for introducing a procedure of serial-section portrayal (thin slicing) of spinal cord specimens for histological study.

Stilling performed the first ovariotomy in Germany, using an extraperitoneal technique that minimized excessive internal bleeding. This procedure is explained in his paper, Geschichte einer Exstirpation eines krankhaft vergrösserten Ovariums.

Eponyms associated with Benedict Stilling 
 Stilling's canal: a small channel that runs through the vitreous humor between the optic disk nerve and the lens in the eye.
 Fleece of Stilling: a mesh of myelinated fibers surrounding the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum.

Subject
Frances Deering Wentworth (1745–1813) was born into a wealthy and well-connected family. Her parents were Samuel Wentworth and Elizabeth Deering. When she was a young teenager, she had fallen in love with her first cousin, John Wentworth. However, he was too invested in establishing his career, and he left America to go to London. In London he managed his family's business. Back in America, Frances was 16 and fell in love with another one of her first cousins, Theodore Atkinson. They wed on May 13, 1762 and moved into their new home in 1765 in Portsmouth. During this time, Theodore commissioned John Singleton Copley to paint a portrait of his wife to display in their home.  

In 1767, John Wentworth made his triumphant return to the American colonies. He was well-established and was now the governor of New Hampshire. Theodore had been in poor health for quite some time and it was rumored that Frances and John, both still in love, were having an affair. Theodore died on October 28, 1769, and a burial followed. Fueling the rumors, Frances and John wed the week following Theodore's death. At the time, Frances wedding shortly after her husband's death was the talk of the town and continued to be for some time. In Harriett Elizabeth Prescott Spofford's 1871 book New England Legends, she wrote:  
“On one day Theodore breathed his last. His burial took place on the following Wednesday; by the Governor’s order all the bells in town were tolled, flags were hung at half-mast, and minute-guns were fired from the fort and from the ships-of-war in the harbor.

Diverse influences ranging from Miró, Matisse and Picasso to Dubuffet, New York school artists like de Kooning, Guston, and Pop artists inform his work, described by critics and curators as chaotically complex and tightly constructed. He often employs energetic, gestural line, dense patterns of accumulated shapes, and fluid movement between figuration and abstraction, using strategies of concealment and revelation to create a sense of meaning that is both playful and elusive. His work is also unified by ""a circulating library"" of motifs and organizing structures, such as geographic and urban mapping, abstracted natural and industrial forms, and language systems. Assessing him at mid-career, New Art Examiner’s Andy Argy wrote ""Himmelfarb’s art is original […] His unabashed immersion in graphic art, emphasizing drawing over painting, has earned him an important place among artists who make drawings into major aesthetic statements."" Himmelfarb next turned to monumental paintings  that critic Christopher Moore called joyful, luminous, and frenetic pyrotechnical displays. In 2006, he began to devote considerable studio time to sculpture that curator Gregg Hertzlieb described as an expression of the ""human need for play and (our) enduring fascination with metamorphosis and transformation.""

Himmelfarb has an extensive exhibition history, notably at the Terry Dintenfass and Luise Ross galleries (New York), Jean Albano Gallery (Chicago), Chicago Cultural Center, Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, Eskenazi Museum of Art (Indiana University, Bloomington), Brooklyn Museum, and Art Institute of Chicago.

The name","Mandan is a city on the eastern border of Morton County and is the seventh-largest city in North Dakota. Founded in 1879 on the west side of the upper Missouri River, it was designated in 1881 as the county seat of Morton County. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the 2017 population at 22,228. Located across the Missouri River from the state capital of Bismarck, Mandan is a core city of the Bismarck-Mandan Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Naming
The city was named after the historic indigenous Mandan of the area. The Mandan are now part of the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, spanning the upper Missouri River in the western part of the state. Their people also live in cities of the state and other areas. In the 2010 census, nearly five percent of the people in the city of Mandan identified as Native American.

The Mandan Indian village located at the southern base of Crying Hill prominent in east Mandan today was recorded as early as 1738 and referred to as the village of Good Fur Robe, named after their chief.  This settlement would also be recorded as the village of the Crying Hill as well the village of the Two Face Stone, after their corresponding geographic features. The village was one of six Mandan villages on the west river bank between today's Knife River and Cannonball River.

The credit for the city's incorporated name is a point of debate. John Andrew Rea originally arrived across the river in Bismarck in 1876 to serve as temporary editor of its newspaper during one of its founder's extended absences. Rea subsequently served as the register in the governmental land office in the territorial capital of Bismarck for eight years starting in June 1880. Rea claimed he and Northern Pacific Railroad engineer Thomas L. Rosser created the name.  Rea would write to the St. Paul Pioneer Press which published and popularized the name which remains in use today.

Thomas, pastor of the Ep","Lucy Thomas (née Williams, baptised 11 March 1781 – 27 September 1847) was a Welsh businesswoman and colliery owner known as 'the mother of the Welsh steam coal trade'. Thomas took over the running of her husband Robert's coal mine after his death in 1833. Unusual as it was at the time that a woman ran the business, more unusually she was also illiterate. Business documents held in the Glamorgan Archives show she signed only with an X. Much of Thomas' subsequent success as a businesswoman was embellished by Merthyr historian Charles Wilkins, who wrote one of the few articles on her life in 1888. It is now believed that George Insole, a Cardiff agent, was one of the chief architects of her success, though this does not diminish Thomas' position as one of the few women coal owners in industrial Britain. It is recorded that Lucy once attended the Coal Exchange in Cardiff only to be told she could not enter. She sent a male clerk in her employ into the Coal Exchange with a letter informing the establishment that 'My coal is equal to any mans, failure to grant entry will lead to my business lining another's pockets'.

Early life
Thomas was baptized in Llansamlet, south Wales on 11 March 1781. Born Lucy Williams to Job Williams and his wife, Ann James, she married Robert Thomas at Llansamlet on 30 June 1802. Robert was a contractor of a coal level, providing fuel for Cyfarthfa Ironworks. They had eight children, six sons and two daughters.

As an industrialist
In 1824 Robert Thomas took up an annual tenancy from Lord Plymouth for the opening and mining of a small coal level at Waun Wyllt, near Abercanaid, south of Merthyr. The contract forbade Robert Thomas from trading with the four local iron-works which were under the ownership of Lord Plymouth. Although little was expected from the level, it was the first to hit the 'Four Foot Seam', a rich deposit of high quality steam coal. The mine initially sold its coal to local households in Merthyr and Cardiff, wit",0,"Lucy Thomas (née Williams, baptised 11","Lucy Thomas (née Williams, baptised 11",10,1.4b

The theatre was established by local theatre artists in 1989. It served as an arts collective serving local and regional theatre, visual arts and musical artists with a focus on helping emerging artists find a place to showcase their talents. The space was primarily a performance space ""black box"" style theatre but often played host to a variety of performance and installation works.

As a ""collective"" the space was run by a revolving membership of artists, some of whom have gone on to open larger, more mainstream theatres in Canada, including Robert Winslow, one of the space's founding members who in 1991 started Fourth Line Theatre in Millbrook, Ontario.

History

The Union Theatre was located at 188½ Hunter Street West in a space rumoured to have been an old undertakers facility (this was the inspiration for the weekly semi-improvised show The Coffin Factory). A group of local theatre artists, including Robert Winslow, Trent University professor Ian McLachlan and members of Theatre Trent, along with other performance artists banded together to continue the work they had done in various Peterborough performance endeavors. One stated aim was finding a permanent home for Winslow's company East City Productions which originally made its home in Peterborough's Market Hall Theatre, the home of the Artspace art gallery. In a Peterborough Examiner article in July 2005, Winslow reminisced about the Union Theatre calling it ""poverty theatre"". Winslow went on to state, ""Nobody was making anything, everyone was poor,"" he says. ""We made all the decisions collectively, which was a real challenge, and basically ran the space.""  In the same article McLachlan said about the Union Theatre: ""It may have been a constant struggle to survive, but the productions that came out of the Union were some of the most innovative this community has seen.

Thai dance, like many forms of traditional Asian dance, can be divided into two major categories that correspond roughly to the high art (classical dance) and low art (folk dance) distinction.

Overview 
The Thai traditional dance and dramatic arts are among the most developed artform in Southeast Asia and has been transmitted to other countries, notably Myanmar and Cambodia. Although the traditional Thai performing arts are not as vibrant as they once were, suffering inroads from Western entertainment and generally changing tastes, Thai dance drama is not extinct. What survives displays the elegance of an art form refined over centuries and supported by regal patronage.

Aside from folk and regional dances (southern Thailand's Indian-influenced manohra dance, for example), the two major forms of Thai classical dance drama are Khon and Lakhon nai. In the beginning, both were exclusively court entertainments and it was not until much later that a popular style of dance theatre, likay, evolved as a diversion for common folk who had no access to royal performances.

Classical dance drama 

Thai classical dance drama include khon, lakhon, and fon Thai.

The first detailed European record of khon and other Thai classical dances was made during the Ayutthaya Kingdom. The tradition and styles employed are almost identical to the Thai traditions we still see today. Historical evidence establishes that the Thai art of stage plays were already perfected by the 17th century. Louis XIV, the Sun King of France, had a formal diplomatic relation with Ayutthaya's King Narai. In 1687, France sent the diplomat Simon de la Loubère to record all that he saw in the Siamese Kingdom and its traditions. In his famous account Du Royaume de Siam, La Loubère carefully observed the classic 17th century theatre of Siam, including an epic battle scene from a Khon performance, and recorded what he saw in g",0,Dance in Thailand ( ram Thai) is the,Dance in Thailand ( ram Thai) is the,10,1.4b

In particular, he hypothesized that dietary saturated fat causes cardiovascular heart disease and should be avoided. Modern dietary recommendations by health organizations, systematic reviews, and national health agencies corroborate this.

Keys studied starvation in men and published The Biology of Human Starvation (1950), which remains the only source of its kind. He examined the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and was responsible for two famous diets: K-rations, formulated as balanced meals for combat soldiers in World War II, and the Mediterranean diet, which he popularized with his wife Margaret. Science, diet, and health were central themes in his professional and private lives.

Early life

Ancel Keys was born in Colorado Springs in 1904 to Benjamin Pious Keys (1883-1961) and Carolyn Emma Chaney (1885-1960), the sister of Lon Chaney. In 1906 they moved to San Francisco before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck. Shortly after the disaster, his family relocated to Berkeley where he grew up. Keys was intelligent as a boy; Lewis Terman, a noted psychologist and inventor of the Stanford-Binet IQ Test, described him as intellectually ""gifted"". During his youth, he left high school to pursue odd jobs, such as shoveling bat guano in Arizona,  a powder monkey in a Colorado mine, and in a lumber camp. He eventually finished his secondary education and was admitted to the University of California at Berkeley in 1922.

Higher education

At the University of California, Berkeley, Keys initially studied chemistry, but was dissatisfied and took some time off to work as an oiler aboard the S.S. President Wilson (1st), which traveled to China. He then returned to Berkeley, switched majors, and graduated with a B.A. in economics and political science (1925) and M.S. in zoology (1928).

The room is fitted with carpets and the walls are covered in mirrors; the instructor does not adjust the students, who are expected to adjust themselves. Choudhury's teaching style was abrasive. 

Bikram Yoga spread rapidly across America and the Western world, reaching a peak of some 1,650 studios in at least 40 countries in 2006. Choudhury attempted to copyright the Bikram Yoga sequence from 2011, but was ultimately unsuccessful. In 2016, facing lawsuits and accusations of sexual assault, Choudhury fled to India, leaving Bikram Yoga, Inc. to be run by others.

Origins

Bikram Choudhury was born in Calcutta in 1944. He began studying yoga in 1969. He arrived in America in 1971, and soon began to teach yoga in health resorts in California. In 1974, two pupils, Shirley MacLaine and Anne Marie Bennstrom, helped him to open his own school at 9441 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. He attracted celebrity pupils including the Hollywood dancer Marge Champion and the actors Keir Dullea, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon, and Raquel Welch. Yoga classes were initially free, with a donation box. Maclaine told Choudhury he could not run an American yoga school like one in India, and he began to charge $5 for classes; attendance started to grow at once.

Choudhury later devised the 26-posture sequence of Bikram Yoga, based on the writings of B. C. Ghosh; he did not study under Ghosh from an early age as he has claimed.

Style

Fleming based the character on a number of people he knew who commanded sections of British intelligence. M has appeared in the novels by Fleming and seven continuation authors, as well as appearing in twenty-four films. In the Eon Productions series of films, M has been portrayed by four actors: Bernard Lee, Robert Brown, Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes, the incumbent; in the two independent productions, M was played by John Huston, David Niven and Edward Fox.

Background

Fleming based much of M's character on Rear Admiral John Godfrey, who was Fleming's superior at the Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War. After Fleming's death, Godfrey complained ""He turned me into that unsavoury character, M.""

Other possible inspirations include Lieutenant Colonel Sir Claude Dansey, the deputy head of MI6 and head of the wartime Z network, who achieved different interpretations of his character from those who knew him: Malcolm Muggeridge thought him ""the only professional in MI6"", while Hugh Trevor-Roper considered Dansey to be ""an utter shit, corrupt, incompetent, but with a certain low cunning"". A further inspiration for M was Maxwell Knight, the head of MI5, who signed his memos as ""M"" and whom Fleming knew well. The tradition of the head of MI6 signing their name with a single letter came from Mansfield Smith-Cumming, who would sign his initial ""C"" navy-style, with green ink.

Another possibility for the model of M was William Melville, an Irishman who became the head of the Secret Service Bureau, the forerunner of both MI5 and MI6: Melville was referred to within government circles as M. Melville recruited Sidney Reilly into government service and foiled an assassination plot against Queen Victoria on her 1887 Golden Jubilee.

F","Some Do Not …, the first volume of Ford Madox Ford's highly regarded tetralogy Parade's End, was originally published in April 1924 by Duckworth and Co. The following is a summary of the plot, chapter by chapter.

Part I

I.i
Some Do Not … begins with the two young friends, Christopher Tietjens and Vincent Macmaster, on the train to Rye for a golfing weekend in the country. The year, probably 1912, is only indicated later. Tietjens has a brilliant mind, and speaks it scathingly and heedlessly. Both men work in London as government statisticians; though Macmaster aspires to be a critic, and has just written a short book on Dante Gabriel Rossetti. He plans to call on a parson who knew Rossetti, and who lives near Rye. The first of the novel's two parts covers the ensuing weekend, which changes both their lives. Tietjens is preoccupied with his disastrous marriage.

I.ii
The second chapter switches to his elegant socialite wife, Sylvia, who is staying with her mother at Lobscheid, a quiet German resort, with their priest, Father Consett. Sylvia had left Tietjens for a lover, Major Perowne, but became bored with him. She's bored in Lobscheid too, but needs the alibi of being there to look after her mother, to account for her absence when she returns to London. Consett probes the state of her marriage, and senses that her anger towards Tietjens is far from indifference.

I.iii
The narrative returns to England. Macmaster startles Tietjens who's playing patience in his hotel room, after what has evidently been a fraught day. The action is then pieced together in retrospect. Tietjens shows Macmaster Sylvia's letter saying she intends to return to him. Macmaster has called on the Rev.

The White Lotus Rebellion (, 17","The White Lotus Rebellion (, 1794–1804) was a rebellion initiated by followers of the White Lotus movement during the Qing dynasty of China. The rebellion began in 1794, when large groups of rebels claiming White Lotus affiliations rose up within the mountainous region that separated Sichuan province from Hubei and Shaanxi provinces. A smaller precursor to the main rebellion broke out in 1774, under the leadership of the martial-arts and herbal-healing expert Wang Lun in Shandong province of northern China.

Although the rebellion was finally crushed by the Qing government in 1804, it marked a turning point in the history of the Qing dynasty. Qing control weakened and prosperity diminished by the 19th century. The rebellion is estimated to have caused the deaths of some 100,000 rebels.

The White Lotus Society

The White Lotus Rebellion was initiated as a antitax protest led by the White Lotus Society, a secret religious society. The White Lotus Society is traditionally considered to have first appeared during the 14th century under the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. The Red Turban Rebellion which took place in 1352, was led by the White Lotus group. By 1387, after more than 30 years of war, their leader, Zhu Yuanzhang conquered the North China Plain and occupied the Yuan capital Khanbaliq (present-day Beijing). Having attained the Mandate of Heaven and the status of Emperor, Zhu Yuanzhang named his period of reign ""Hongwu"" (thus he was known as the Hongwu Emperor) and founded a new dynasty – the Ming dynasty. The group later reemerged in the late 18th century in the form of an inspired Chinese movement.

Though many movements and rebellions were considered by imperial bureaucrats to have been led by White Lotus Society leaders, there is reason to doubt that the White Lotus Society had any organizational unity. BJ Ter Haar has argued that the term ""White Lotus"" was used primarily by Ming and Qing imperial bureaucrats to disparagingly explain a wide ",0,"The White Lotus Rebellion (, 1794","The White Lotus Rebellion (, 1794",10,1.4b

Due to new genetic research, it has now been placed in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. Three species of Nuttallanthus are native to North America and one to South America.  Nuttallanthus was until the 1980s included in a wider circumscription of the genus Linaria, a genus now considered restricted to the Old World.

The members of this genus are known in English as toadflax, a name shared with several other related genera. The scientific name honors Thomas Nuttall.

Species
Nuttallanthus canadensis (Canada toadflax or oldfield toadflax)
Nuttallanthus floridanus (Apalachicola toadflax)
Nuttallanthus texanus (Texas toadflax)

Canada toadflax (Nuttallanthus canadensis, syn. Linaria canadensis) is native to eastern North America, in southern Canada and the United States. It is a purple to blue, weedy species, which blooms early in the spring. It is an important nectar source for spring buildup of honeybees, because the plants are often so thick in fields, and they bloom so early.

The North American species do not appear to form interspecific hybrids at all.  The most common mode of reproduction is self-fertilization, with occasional fertilization by another plant of the same species.

Closely related genera include the Linaria (Eurasian toadflaxes), Antirrhinum (snapdragons) and Cymbalaria (ivy-leaved toadflaxes).

It was the first film produced by Mel Brooks's Brooksfilms company. The film examines the subject matter of obesity, addiction, family and singlehood.

Plot
As the DiNapoli siblings -- Antoinette (Anne Bancroft), Dominic (Dom DeLuise), and Frank Jr. (Ron Carey) - are growing up, whenever young Dom was unhappy, the one thing his mother did to comfort him and make him feel cared for was to feed him something scrumptious. One example was Dom's mom giving her older son a cannoli after the boy got urinated on by his baby brother Frankie as the baby's diaper is being changed. Because of this, Dom grew up with a love of food, a trait shared by his equally obese cousin, Salvatore (Sal).

When Sal suddenly dies at age 39, the family grieves. This prompts Antoinette to urge Dom to visit a diet doctor to avoid his cousin's unhealthy eating habits and not drive himself into an early grave as well. Dom agrees to do so once he recognizes signs that obesity is ruining his health. Dom is deeply disheartened when given his new diet plan, seeing the long list of delectable foods and dishes that he enjoys very much but now must avoid. When the diet fails, Dom's eating habits drive his sister crazy, so she enrolls him in the ""Chubby Checkers"" support group.

Meanwhile, Dom meets Lydia (Candice Azzara), who owns the neighborhood antiques shop, and finds they have a lot in common. But being self-conscious about his weight, he fears rejection, and can't bring himself to ask her out. 

Dom had Frankie padlock the fridge and larder, but that proves to be little help because in the middle of the night, Dom, crazed by cravings for his favorite decadent delights (even having dreamed of marzipan candy), demands the keys from his brother, even threatening him with violence at one point, of which he is extremely ashamed ",0,Fatso is a 1980 American comedy-drama,Fatso is a 1980 American comedy-drama,10,1.4b

The 11th-century parish church has no dedication; the ecclesiastical parish is joined with Westmeston.

Etymology
Anglo-Saxon place names containing ""Street"", ""Streat"" or ""Stret"" usually indicate a Roman road, and this is the case here, as Streat is built on the Sussex Greensand Way, and there is a north-south Roman or Romanised Celtic road known as the Middleton Track just over the west parish boundary border at Hayleigh Farm sweeping past Grade II listed Middleton Manor  which ascends the South Downs escarpment passing above the Victoria Jubilee Middleton Plantation.

Landmarks 
Clayton to Offham Escarpment is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, which stretches from Hassocks in the west and passes through many parishes including Streat, to Lewes in the east. The site is of biological importance due to its rare chalk grassland habitat along with its woodland and scrub.

Old Rectory
There is an Old Rectory, a listed building, which may indicate the existence of chancel repair liability  to any lay improprietors of land which was once belonged to the church.

Streat Place
Streat Place is a manor house built in the early 17th century by Walter Dobell who died in 1624. The building has an E shaped plan with central porch and projecting wings. Its national listing gives it as Grade II* and reveals its architectural merit as including its entire facing of knapped flints with long and short ashlar quoins to each window bay.

Streat Hill
The long north-south parish reaches its highest point in its southern quarter, here Streat Hill rises to 224m above sea level; here there are two earthworks or tumuli.  These are two bowl barrows which are termed by archaeologists the Western Brow round barrow cemetery.

Founded in 1911, the battalion in 1912 became part of the Royal Flying Corps, which in turn evolved into the Royal Air Force.

Establishment
In 1911, following the growth in early aviation activity, the War Office issued instructions for the School of Ballooning, which had originally been formed in 1888, to be expanded into a battalion. An order was issued on 28 February 1911 for the formation of the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers effective 1 April the same year. The initial establishment was 14 officers and 150 other ranks. Officers could be selected from any branch of the service whereas other ranks were selected from the Corps of Royal Engineers.

Pilots had to already have earned a Royal Aero Club certificate from a private flying school. The GBP 75 charge for flight training was reimbursed only if the student passed the course.

Structure and activities
The battalion comprised two companies and a headquarters located at Farnborough. The commander of the Air Battalion was Major Sir Alexander Bannerman.

No. 1 Company, at Farnborough, was equipped with airships and was under the command of Captain Edward Maitland, an experienced balloon and airship pioneer. He also helped pioneer the parachute and in 1913 made the first parachute jump from an airship.

No. 2 Company, at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain, was equipped with aeroplanes and was commanded by Captain John Fulton. A mechanical engineer from the Royal Field Artillery, Fulton had been an early enthusiast of military flying and had attended the world's first air show at Rheims in 1909. He had earned his pilot's certificate, number 27, on 15 November 1910.

The School was formed in 1996 with the merger of the architecture departments of the University of Manchester (then Victoria University of Manchester) and Manchester Metropolitan University. Students of MSA are classified as students of both universities and are issued with separate cards for each university, allowing them to use the resources and facilities of both institutions. Upon graduating the degree is awarded by both universities.

The School covers three main aspects of architectural education. An undergraduate course (BA Hons) which has exemption to the RIBA Part One exam; a professional postgraduate course (MArch) offers exemption to the RIBA Part Two exams; and finally a range of postgraduate Masters and PhD courses.

School

Researchers from the Manchester Architectural Research Centre (MARC) input directly into the graduate teaching. MARC is a multidisciplinary research team based at the University of Manchester: its staff and post-graduates are researchers in a variety of affiliated fields of study, and offer an interdisciplinary context for architectural research at MSA.

Graduation ceremony of Manchester School of Architecture is held in turn annually between the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University. For example, graduates of 2013 attended the ceremony with fellow University of Manchester students in Whitworth Hall, while the 2014 graduation was held by Manchester Metropolitan University in an external rented venue.

The traditional county town is Nottingham, though the county council is based at County Hall in West Bridgford in the borough of Rushcliffe, at a site facing Nottingham over the River Trent.

The districts of Nottinghamshire are Ashfield, Bassetlaw, Broxtowe, Gedling, Mansfield, Newark and Sherwood, and Rushcliffe. The City of Nottingham was administratively part of Nottinghamshire between 1974 and 1998, but is now a unitary authority, remaining part of Nottinghamshire for ceremonial purposes.

In 2017, the county was estimated to have a population of 785,800.  
Over half of the population of the county live in the Greater Nottingham conurbation (which continues into Derbyshire). The conurbation has a population of about 650,000, though less than half live within the city boundaries.

History

Nottinghamshire lies on the Roman Fosse Way, and there are Roman settlements in the county; for example at Mansfield, and forts such as at the Broxtowe Estate in Bilborough. The county was settled by Angles around the 5th century, and became part of the Kingdom, and later Earldom, of Mercia. However, there is evidence of Saxon settlement at the Broxtowe Estate, Oxton, near Nottingham, and Tuxford, east of Sherwood Forest. The name first occurs in 1016, but until 1568, the county was administratively united with Derbyshire, under a single Sheriff. In Norman times, the county developed malting and woollen industries. During the industrial revolution, the county held much needed minerals such as coal and iron ore, and had constructed some of the first experimental waggonways in the world; an example of this is the Wollaton wagonway of 1603-1616, which transported minerals from bell pitt mining areas at Strelley and Bilborough, this led t",0,Nottinghamshire (pronounced ; abbreviated N,Nottinghamshire (pronounced ; abbreviated N,10,1.4b

He was educated at the University of Pennsylvania, and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania","Ruben Rivers (1921 – November 19, 1944) was a United States Army staff sergeant who was killed in action while serving as a tank company platoon sergeant during World War II. In 1997, he was awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military decoration for valor, for his actions on November 16–19, 1944, near Bourgaltroff, France.

Rivers (half-Cherokee) and six other Black Americans who served in World War II, were awarded the Medal of Honor on January 12, 1997. The Medal of Honor was posthumously presented to Rivers by President Bill Clinton on January 13, 1997 during a Medals of Honor ceremony for the seven recipients at the White House in Washington, D.C. The seven recipients are the first and only Black Americans to be awarded the Medal of Honor for World War II.

Biography
Rivers was born to Willie and Lillian Rivers in 1921 in Tecumseh, Oklahoma.  He grew up in nearby Hotulka, Oklahoma, where he and his eleven brothers and sisters worked on the family farm.  In 1930, the family moved to Earlsboro. After graduating from high school, Rivers worked on the railroad for a time.

Military service
With the United States' entry into World War II on behalf of the Allied cause, Rivers and two of his brothers joined the armed forces.  Ruben would be the only one assigned to a combat unit however, training with the 761st Tank Battalion at Camp Hood in Texas.  The 761st Tank Battalion, nicknamed the ""Black Panthers"", was eventually assigned to General George S. Patton's U.S. Third Army.  Despite Patton's racism, the battalion was implemented and performed with distinction in a number of important battles, although Patton did not officially recognize their accomplishments.

Rivers, a tank platoon sergeant in Able Company, 761st Tank Battalion, would play a critical role in some of the earliest action the 761st would see, becoming the battalion's initial hero, but also one of its first casualties.

It produces single, lemon-coloured inflorescences. It is an allelopathic plant. Like most hawkweed species, it is highly variable and is a member of a species complex of several dozens of subspecies and hundreds of varieties and forms.

Description 
It is a hispid (hairy) perennial plant, with a basal rosette of leaves. The whole plant, with the exception of the flower parts, is covered in glandular hairs, usually whitish, sometimes reddish on the stem. The rosette leaves are entire, acute to blunt, and range from  long and  broad. Their underside is tomentose (covered with hair). The flowering stem (scape) is generally between  tall, and sprouts from the centre of the basal rosette. The flowerheads are borne singly on the scape and are a pale lemon-yellow colour, with the outermost ligules having a reddish underside. It flowers from May until August and the flowers are visited by various groups of insects, especially flies.

The plant favours dry, sunny areas. It grows well on sandy and similarly less fertile ground types. It produces stolons which generate a new rosette at their extremity, each rosette has the possibility of developing into a new clone forming dense mats in open space. It also propagates by seeds.

Ecology 
It is a known allelopathic plant, whose roots secrete several substances inhibiting root growth, including its own. It can be controlled through rotation with clover and grasses where possible.

Recent research claims that Pilosella officinarum exhibits an atavism by the reemergence of sexual reproduction.

A.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that a plaintiff may not recover damages for a tort that was not proximately caused by the defendant's negligent act or omission. See, e.g., United States v. G.I. du","Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction to decide civil claims brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).

Background
RICO is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. Following its enactment in 1970, there had been a disagreement in federal and state court decisions as to whether state courts had jurisdiction to decide claims filed under this federal statute.

In 1962 Maryland established a quasi-public non-profit corporation, the Maryland Savings-Share Insurance Corporation (MSSIC), to insure accounts held in state chartered savings and loan associations. In May 1985, rumors of financial instability in two thrifts, Old Court Savings and Loans and Merritt Commercial Savings and Loan, led to depositors questioning whether MSSIC was financially able to guarantee all of the deposits, resulting in a run on all state savings and loan associations. This led to the withdrawal of deposits, the failure of Old Court and the subsequent collapse of MSSIC. The Maryland General Assembly during special sessions in 1985 established the Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund (MDIF) to replace the MSSIC.

Nonresident holders of certificates of deposit issued by Old Court in federal district court sued Jeffrey Levitt, the former president of Old Court, the other officers and directors of Old Court and of the MSSIC, Old Court's law and accounting firms, and MDIF, asserting various state law causes of action and claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and RICO. The district court determined that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the Securities Exchange Act, and, since the state courts had concurrent jurisdiction over the RICO claim, ruled that federal abstention over the case was appropriate",3,"Tafflin v.

Early life
Emura graduated from Osaka Tōin High School. From the fall of his second year he became the school's starting catcher and contributed to the school finishing runners-up in the 2009 Kinki tournament, which earned the school a place at the 2010 spring invitational national tournament. During his final year of high school, Emura was drafted by the Marines in the fifth round of the 2010 rookie draft.

Professional career
After two years with Marines' farm team, Emura made his first-team debut early in the 2013 season. On June 3, 2013, in a match between the Marines and the Swallows, Emura faced his rookie brother Masaya for the first time in a professional match. With the count at three balls and one strike, Emura swung at the fifth pitch and grounded out to short stop. In a post-match interview, Masaya described Emura as a ""kind younger brother"" for swinging at a pitch that was going to be a ball; had he not swung he would've walked to first base. Emura said he ""tried too hard"" and that he thought his parents would be the happiest at seeing the brothers compete for the first time. Although Masaya won the battle against his brother, Emura's Marines defeated the Swallows 4–0 in the match. By the end of the 2013 season Emura had made 64 appearances for the Marines' first team, finishing with a batting average of .171, 6 runs and 7 RBIs. He made the most appearances out of the Marines' pool of catchers but was mainly used as a bench player, entering matches to replace veterans Tomoya Satozaki, Takeshi Kanazawa and Ryohei Kawamoto.

It discusses matters of military strategy, and is considered to be one of the Seven Military Classics of China.

Content
The content of Questions and Replies differs strongly from the other six Military Classics. The armies that existed by the time of the Tang dynasty consisted of infantry, crossbowmen, and cavalry. The use of the chariot had long since ceased to have any military application, and weapons were exclusively made from iron and steel. Large number of local, cohesive units provided a great degree of flexibility to large-scale deployments. Professional units were supplemented by disciplined and well-armed conscript forces. Weapons and unit sub-types were highly specialized. The recognition of the military value of speed and mobility was widespread, with flanking and other indirect maneuvers preferred over direct, frontal engagements.

The social and technological realities from which Questions and Replies was written were very different from the other six Military Classics. Rather than claiming to originate its own strategy, Questions and Replies frames itself as a survey of earlier, more widely recognized works, discussing their theories and contradictions according to the writer's own military experience. Because Li Jing was a historically successful general, the tactics and strategies discussed in Questions and Replies must be considered the theoretical product of actions tested and employed in battles critical to the establishment of the Tang dynasty, if it is indeed wholly or even partly the product of Li Jing's thoughts.

In his letter Alcuin gives Coelchu an account of the state of religion on the Continent, mentions Joseph, one of Coelchu's pupils then in France, and speaks of disputes between King Charles and Offa of Mercia, on account of which he himself was likely to be sent as negotiator into England. This indicates that the letter was written shortly before 790.

Scott, Michelle Meyrink, John Goodman, Timothy Busfield, Andrew Cassese and Donald Gibb.  The film's plot chronicles a group of nerds at the fictional Adams College trying to stop the ongoing harassment by the jock fraternity, the Alpha Betas, in addition to the latter's sister sorority, Pi Delta Pi.

Plot
Best friends and nerds Lewis Skolnick and Gilbert Lowe enroll in Adams College to study computer science. The Alpha Betas, a fraternity that includes most of the Adams football team, carelessly burn down their own house, and urged by Coach Harris, take over the freshman dorms. Dean Ulich designates temporary living space in the gymnasium, and allows the freshmen to rush the fraternities. Lewis, Gilbert, and several other nerds fail to join fraternities, but are able to secure a dilapidated house near campus and repair it as a residence.

The Alpha Betas, led by star quarterback Stan Gable, are irked by the nerds' success, and Stan sets his fellow members to pull pranks against the nerds. The nerds try to get campus police to help, but the campus cops are constrained by the Greek Council that adjudicates all such pranks, of which Stan is currently president. The nerds decide to seek membership on the Greek Council by joining a national fraternity. The only one that considers them is the black fraternity Lambda Lambda Lambda (Tri-Lambs), led by U.N. Jefferson. Jefferson is wary of their application but agrees to a probationary period.

Early life

Born in Württemberg, the daughter of a German-born American, Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria","Antonia of Württemberg (24 March 1613 – 1 October 1679) was a princess of the Duchy of Württemberg, as well as a literary figure, patroness, and Christian Kabbalist.

Life 

Born in Stuttgart in 1613, Princess Antonia was the third of nine children from the marriage of Duke Johann Frederick of Württemberg and Barbara Sophie of Brandenburg, the daughter of the Elector Joachim Frederick of Brandenburg.  Highly educated and generous, she was the sister of Duke Eberhard III of Württemberg, who more than his father played an important role in the Thirty Years War.

During the course of the war many churches in Württemberg were looted and became stripped of their ornaments, especially following the battle of Nördlingen in 1634. Antonia made it her mission to establish foundations to repair and restore the churches.  Her charity, piety, gift for languages and all-encompassing scholarship were widely praised, and she became celebrated as ""Princess Antonia the learned"", and ""the Minerva of Württemberg"". Wherever possible she dedicated herself to the arts and sciences, together with her two sisters the princesses Anna Johanna and Sibylle.

She became a close associate of the evangelical Protestant theologian and mystical symbolist Johann Valentin Andreae, and later was on friendly terms with the founder of the Pietism movement, Philip Jacob Spener.  In addition to painting, her interests were above all in the realm of philosophy and languages, with a special preference for Hebrew, and the study of the Jewish Kabbalah.  Her specifically Christian expression of this tradition found its culmination in the unique large Kabbalistic triptych painting designed and commissioned by Princess Antonia and her academic teachers in 1652, installed in 1673 in the small town church of Holy Trinity at Bad Teinach-Zavelstein in the Black Forest, a personal witness of faith.

Princess Antonia died in 1679, having never married.  Her body was buried in the Collegiate Chur",0,Antonia of Württemberg (,Antonia of Württemberg (,10,1.4b

The film is a remake of the classic film The Great Gatsby. The film was released in the United States on May 25, 1971. The film was released in the United States on May 25, 1971. The film was released in the United States on May 25, 1971. The film was released","Fata Morgana is a 1971 film by Werner Herzog, shot in 1968 and 1969, which captures mirages in the Sahara and Sahel deserts. Herzog also wrote the voiceover narration by Lotte H. Eisner, which recites the Mayan creation myth, the Popol Vuh.

Production
The film was shot sporadically over a 13-month period from November 1968 to December 1969. Most of the footage was shot in Africa with little notion as to how it would eventually be used. A concept and structure for the film was invented by Herzog only after filming was completed. Post production extended into 1970 as the director concentrated on completing his Even Dwarfs Started Small for its May premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.

Much of the film's footage consists of long tracking shots filmed by cameraman Jörg Schmidt-Reitwein from the top of a Volkswagen camper van with Herzog driving. The crew smoothed out the road themselves to prepare the shots.

Herzog and the crew encountered many problems during the filming. In Cameroon they were imprisoned because cameraman Schmidt-Reitwein's name was similar to the name of a German mercenary who was hiding from the authorities and had recently been sentenced to death in absentia. They also encountered sandstorms and floods. Filming eventually came to a halt when they were forced to abandon their truck and all equipment at a border crossing. Herzog said of the arduous filming conditions ""It forces real life, genuine life into the film"". During the course of filming, Herzog himself was thrown into a rat-infested jail where he was beaten, and contracted the parasitic blood disease bilharzia.

The film was initially intended to be presented with a science fiction narrative, casting the images as landscapes of a dying planet. This concept was abandoned as soon as filming began, but was realized in Herzog's later films Lessons of Darkness and The Wild Blue Yonder. Herzog has said of the film that it takes place ""on the planet Uxmal, which is disco",2,Fata Morgana is a 1971 film by Werner Herzog,Fata Morgana is a 1971 film by Werner Herzog,10,1.4b

Plot
First part

Gaetano Castiglia, aged thirty-nine is a doctor of good stock who studied in Boston but isn't practising. He lives with his mother Maddalena in Montrone, in the area near Avellino, while Vincenzo, his father, died a long time before. Gaetano falls in love with Sabina, a barely seventeen-year-old girl after they meet each other by chance during a procession. His mother is against their marriage, because Sabina is a poor, uncultured orphan who has worked in a tavern run by an aunt. Gaetano becomes hardheaded and does everything he can to persuade his mother to accept Sabina. He is very jealous and is worried about the fact that Sabina can make bad experiences at the inn, frequented by  farmers and drunkards. To prepare for the marriage, he forces Sabina to move to another aunt's house in Atripalda, a nearby town, to learn to read and write and to behave in a more dignified way because he doesn't want her to have relationships with other people of lower class.
Second part
The marriage is celebrated. On the wedding night, in a hotel in Naples, Gaetano becomes aware of the fact that Sabina is not a virgin. At first she denies this but she is later forced to reveal that she has had a sexual relationship with Vincenzo Carbone, an officer in Turin. Initially, he raped her in a stable, but later she convinced herself to see him in her house, because Elena, Carbone's sister, promised her a marriage with her brother. 

On hearing this, Gaetano decides to go back to Montrone. The following night, he kills Sabina by slitting her throat with a razor blade. He then goes to Elena, who runs a shop and kills her with",0,Un delitto d'onore (= Honour,Un delitto d'onore (= Honour,10,1.4b

The title of the song was originally ""Hey Brother"".

She further added that ""When you combine the body with video and music, it can create a feeling that defies the physics and gravity of the real world; the body becomes a bit more ephemeral and the animation can then become more tangible and have a weight to it.""

Setting
Matreyek projected her own body doing domestic chores at home and with animation and projection transports to different scapes of universe.

He was born Woldetensae Gizaw in March, 1919 near the monastery of Itisa Debre Tsilalsh, Tegulet and Bulga Awraja, Shewa to a clerical family.  His father, a married priest, was named Kesis Gizaw Zeyohnes and his mother was Woizero Zenebech Yeshi.  His family claimed descent from the same family that produced the deeply revered Ethiopian Saint Abuna Tekle Haymanot.  Young Woldetensae was ordained a deacon by the Coptic Archbishop of Ethiopia, Abuna Qerellos in 1929. He later joined the resistance against the Italian occupation for five years from 1936 to 1941.  Upon the liberation of Ethiopia and the restoration of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1941, Woldetensae entered the Debre Libanos Monastery and took monastic vows becoming a monk priest.

He also served as a priest in Harar, Dire Dawa, Ogaden and Addis Ababa.
In 1954, he went to Woliso, then called Ghion, where he began preaching to the local population. Abba Woldetensae's reputation as a healer and an exorciser of evil spirits through prayer and holy water spread, and pilgrims flocked to him from around Ethiopia and indeed from outside the country as well. He established the Bethesaida Kidist Mariam (St. Mary of Bethesda) Church and Monastery at Woliso. This church has since become a popular place of pilgrimage for Ethiopian Christians as well as people from other religions.

Abba Woldetensae was made a bishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in 1976, taking the name of Dioskoros. Abuna Dioskoros served as Bishop of the West Shoa and Gurage Diocese in Central Ethiopia. After he died, his body was interred in the church and his statue stands in the compound. Many pilgrims still travel to his church seeking cure and religious blessings.

They were predominantly  members of Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, Quicksilver Messenger Service, and Crosby, Stills and Nash.  Their first album together was Blows Against the Empire, when they were known as Jefferson Starship.  

Starship founder Paul Kantner then came up with the term ""Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra"", a label of reference to the San Francisco musicians that played on David Crosby's If I Could Only Remember My Name.  During the sessions for Crosby's album at Wally Heider Studios, the musicians of each band (who were working in other rooms) dropped in to the sessions and improvised hours of music, and everything was recorded.  Some of the basic tracks played during these recorded sessions in 1971 were used for Crosby's album. Engineer Stephen Barncard and David Crosby made rough mixes of some of the session tapes, and in 1991 Graham Nash sent a DAT tape to Paul Kantner which later showed up in the tape trading markets as a 'pristine' digital copy. Barncard came up with the PERRO abbreviation when he needed to identify the 2 inch wide tapes on sides, standing vertically.

The ""PERRO Chorus"" is credited on Crosby's song, ""What Are Their Names"") and several other solo albums after Crosby's (see discography). The name Jefferson Starship was later used for Paul Kantner and Grace Slick's new band formed in 1974.  Paul Kantner recorded a solo album in 1983 as a tribute to this time, Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra.

He and Amatus of Grenoble founded Remiremont Abbey.

Biography
He was a former Count Palatine in the court of the Merovingian king, Theodebert II. His parents were killed by Queen Brunhilda, and because of the enmity of his family with this queen, he wandered without a home. However, with the fall of the Queen, he was received at the court of Chlothar II and his lands restored.

Disenchanted with life as a courtier, Romaric experienced a religious conversion through the missionary efforts of Amatus of Grenoble, a monk of Luxeuil Abbey. Romaric entered Luxeuil and trained to be a monk. With the approval of Abbot Eustace, Romaric and Amatus founded a double monastery for men and women, later given the name of Remiremont (Romarici Mons). The monastery was built on land belonging to St. Romaric, when he was a count palatine. One of the earlier monks in Remiremont was St. Romaric's friend St. Arnulf.

Around 625 Romaric succeeded Amatus as abbot. He directed several members of his family who embraced religious life there: two of his daughters, Azeltruda and Zeberga, his granddaughter Gebetruda, and his grandson Adelphus.

Romaric died in 653.

Romaric is recognized as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church, with a feast day on December 10 or December 8. He was canonized on 3 December 1049 by Pope Leo IX.

Description 
Species in this superfamily can be average (under 10 cm) to very large (over 30 cm), are relatively flat, have an inverted egg-shaped outline, a glabella that in early genera has parallel sides and expands forward in later representatives, and approaches or reaches the frontal border. All species have an almost semicircular headshield (or cephalon) with long backward directed genal spines. The facial suture in front of the eye diverges forward and outward in the Paradoxididae, while in the Centropleuridae it runs outward and even a bit backward (or retrodivergent). The articulate middle part of the body (or thorax) consists of 14 to 21 segments ending in sickle-shaped spines that to the back curve increasingly further backwards (Paradoxididae) or in bluntly truncated tips (Centropleuridae). While in the Paradoxididae the frontal two segments may be more robust, the thorax of the Centropleuridae is characterize by longer backward directed sickle shaped spines on the three rear thorax segments. The tailshield (or pygidium) is typically small with an entire margin in Paradoxididae, and medium-sized with 2 or 3 pairs of marginal spines in the Centropleuridae.

It is administered in his name by the pastor and people of the Cathedral of St. Joseph, Manchester. Situated on  on two sites, the older in Manchester and the newer in Bedford, New Hampshire, it has served the Catholic families of Manchester for over 160 years.

Early years
The first recorded burial in what is now Saint Joseph Cemetery was that of Bartholomeu Quinn, who died July 2, 1848. Father William McDonald, Manchester's first permanently assigned Catholic priest, acquired land on a hillside overlooking the city's West Side, more than two miles (3 km) from downtown when Mr. Quinn's death made the establishment of a Catholic cemetery a necessity.

For more than twenty years, Father McDonald administered the cemetery from his rectory office at Saint Anne's Church. The only known references in print, however, refer to it simply as “the Catholic cemetery in ‘Squog.” “‘Squog” is the nickname given to a broad expanse of land on the banks of the Piscataquog River near its confluence with the Merrimack River, all on Manchester's West Side.

By 1869, the Catholic population had grown too large for just one parish. Bishop James Augustine Healy of Portland, Maine, to whose diocese Manchester still belonged, sent Father John O’Brien to assist Father McDonald by establishing a new parish, this one dedicated to Saint Joseph. Father O’Brien was succeeded by Father Denis Mary Bradley, who would go on to become New Hampshire's first Catholic bishop. Under his pastorate, control of the cemetery was ceded to Saint Joseph parish. The cemetery has borne Saint Joseph's name ever since.

George Pottinger was born in 1916, the elder son of the Reverend William Pottinger, MA, of Orkney. He was educated at George Watson's College in Edinburgh and the High School of Glasgow, before proceeding to further study at the University of Edinburgh, Heidelberg University and Queens' College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a major scholarship and graduated with a BA in Anglo-Saxon Studies and English. In 1939 he entered the Scottish Home Department as an Assistant Principal, and upon his return in 1945 following war service he was successively promoted from Principal to Assistant Secretary (1952–9) and Under-Secretary (1959–62). He also spent time as Private Secretary to three Secretaries of State for Scotland – Arthur Woodburn, Hector McNeil and James Stuart – from 1949 to 1952, and as Secretary of the Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs (1952–4).

The Aviemore project
During the late 1950s, John Maclay, then Secretary of State for Scotland, appointed Lord Fraser of Allander (then Sir Hugh Fraser) to head a survey of tourist resources in the Highlands. Pottinger was put on secondment to Fraser, and in 1962 was asked by ministers to assist the Scottish Tourist Board in preparing a Bill that would allow for a series of investment grants and, potentially, a special tax on overnight accommodation in the area. In a letter to Maclay, he noted that one additional problem inherent in developing the Highlands as a tourist destination was the ""shortage of top-class hotel accommodation"", and that an ""ambitious project which will really strike people's imagination"" was now needed. This advice was taken on board: following further rounds of negotiation with various agencies and groups, a £5m redevelopment of Aviemore as a winter sports complex was eventually",0,(William) George Pottinger (11 June,(William) George Pottinger (11 June,10,1.4b

In physical geography and image analysis, it is similar to the modifiable areal unit problem. Simon A. Levin (1992) states that the problem of relating phenomena across scales is the central problem in biology and in all of science. Understanding the SPO is thus one central theme in ecology.

Pattern description 

This pattern is often plotted as log-transformed grain (cell size) versus log-transformed occupancy. Kunin (1998) presented a log-log linear SPO and suggested a fractal nature for species distributions. It has since been shown to follow a logistic shape, reflecting a percolation process. Furthermore, the SPO is closely related to the intraspecific occupancy-abundance relationship. For instance, if individuals are randomly distributed in space, the number of individuals in an α-size cell follows a Poisson distribution, with the occupancy being Pα = 1 − exp(−μα), where μ is the density. Clearly, Pα in this Poisson model for randomly distributed individuals is also the SPO. Other probability distributions, such as the negative binomial distribution, can also be applied for describing the SPO and the occupancy-abundance relationship for non-randomly distributed individuals.

Other occupancy-abundance models that can be used to describe the SPO includes Nachman's exponential model, Hanski and Gyllenberg's metapopulation model, He and Gaston's improved negative binomial model by applying Taylor's power law between the mean and variance of species distribution, and Hui and McGeoch's droopy-tail percolation model. One important application of the SPO in ecology is to estimate species abundance based on presence-absence data, or occupancy alone. This is appealing because obtaining presence-absence data is often cost-efficient.

Amano is one of three NFL players to be born in the Philippines, along with Tim Tebow and Fred Jones.

High school career
He attended Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego, California, where he was an all-conference performer as an offensive and defensive lineman during his senior season and also lettered in basketball and track.

Late into his senior year, Amano had no scholarship offers and planned to walk-on to either the University of New Mexico or San Diego State University. But when SE Missouri State called one of his high school coaches about players on his team, he sold the recruiters on Amano. The recruiters acquired a tape of Amano and immediately offered him a scholarship.

College career
He attended Southeast Missouri State University. As a senior, he won the Division I-AA Dave Rimington Trophy, given annually to top center in college football at each level of competition. Amano was also named first-team All-American by the American Football Coaches Association, The NFL Draft Report and Football Gazette.

Using the original tracks, Prince added additional music, as well as contributions from a new lineup suspiciously resembling The New Power Generation, including Rosie Gaines, Larry Graham and Doug E. Fresh.  The EP was released in the U.S. on CD, as well as a rare purple vinyl 12-inch.

Although Prince was still going by his unpronounceable, symbolic moniker at the time, he released the EP as ""Prince and the Revolution"", with the word Revolution written in reverse, as it had been on the original 1999 album cover.  The Revolution members on the original track (Lisa Coleman and Dez Dickerson) did not participate in the re-recording, however.  In fact ""The Inevitable Mix"" of the track cut out the original members altogether and replaced them with Graham and Gaines.  Three of the tracks had very little to do with ""1999"" at all.  ""Keep Steppin'"" and ""Rosie & Doug E. In a Deep House"" were little more than opportunities for Fresh to rap and Rosie Gaines to scat.  The track called ""Rosario"" featured actress Rosario Dawson performing a political spoken word over the chords of ""Little Red Corvette"".

The original track has since been released on two hits compilations by Warner Bros.

Biography
He was the last Prime Minister to lead a liberal cabinet and the last liberal to be Prime Minister until Mark Rutte in 2010 (92 years later). However, the First Rutte cabinet only held a minority in the House of Representatives. One of Cort van der Linden's major achievements was maintaining Dutch neutrality during World War I, although personally he was pro-German.

He also introduced universal suffrage in the Netherlands in what is nowadays known as the Pacification of 1917. Because of this, the Social Democratic Workers' Party and the General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses won the 1918 elections. The Catholic Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck took Cort van der Linden's place as Prime Minister.

B-cells are lymphocytes that normally function in the humoral immunity component of the adaptive immune system by secreting antibodies that, for example, bind to and neutralize invasive pathogens. Among the various forms of B-cell lymphomas, THRLBCL is a rarely occurring subtype of the diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). DLBCL are a large group of lymphomas that account for ~25% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas worldwide. THRLBCL is distinguished from the other DLBCL subtypes by the predominance of non-malignant T-cell lymphocytes and histiocytes over malignant B-cells in its tumors and tissue infiltrates.

THRLBCL commonly afflicts middle-aged individuals but has been diagnosed in rare pediatric cases. The disease usually presents with lymphadenopathy, i.e. bulky enlargements of lymph nodes in the neck, arm pit, or groin. However, most cases are at an advanced stage at diagnoses: further examinations frequently reveal that the disease has spread to multiple internal organs and tissues. The course of the disease is usually characterized as being poorly responsive to treatment: the disease's survival rates in past studies have been only ~46%. However, recent studies suggest that novel treatments can improve these survival rates. 

Many studies have found that THRLBCL can overlap with the variant form of nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). That is, some cases of variant NLPHL, which is a relatively indolent malignancy, share with THRLBCL similar disease presentations, histologies (i.e. microscopic appearances), genetic abnormalities, and apparent etiologies. Indeed, NLPHL can, in rare cases, progress into THRLBCL. Comapared to THRLBCK, however, these variant NLPHL cases are less aggressive, are more responsive to treatment, and have a better prognosis. Thus, THRLBCL and NLPHL may be biologically related diseases that rep",0,T-cell/histiocyte-rich large,T-cell/histiocyte-rich large,10,1.4b

Almost all retained teeth and clawed fingers on each wing, but otherwise looked much like modern birds externally. Over 80 species of enantiornitheans have been named, but some names represent only single bones, so it is likely that not all are valid. Enantiornitheans became extinct at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, along with hesperornithids and all other non-avian dinosaurs. They are thought to have no living descendants.

Discovery and naming 
The first enantiornitheans to be discovered were incorrectly referred to modern bird groups. For example, the first known enantiornithean, Gobipteryx minuta, was originally considered a paleognath related to ostriches and tinamou. Enantiornitheans were first recognized as a distinct lineage, or ""subclass"" of birds, by Cyril A. Walker in 1981. Walker made this discovery based on some partial remains from the late Cretaceous period of what is now Argentina, which he assigned to a new genus, Enantiornis, giving the entire group its name. Since the 1990s, many more complete enantiornitheans have been discovered, and it was determined that a few previously described ""birds"" (e.g. Iberomesornis, Cathayornis, and Sinornis) were also enantiornitheans.

The name ""Enantiornithes"" means ""opposite birds"", from Ancient Greek enantios (ἐνάντιος) ""opposite"" + ornithes (όρνιθες) ""birds"" . The name was coined by Cyril Alexander Walker in his landmark paper which established the group. In his paper, Walker explained what he meant by ""opposite"":

This refers to an anatomical feature – the articulation of the shoulder bones – which has a concave-convex socket joint that is the reverse of that of modern birds. Specifically, in enantiornitheans, the facet where the scapula (shoulder blade) meets the coracoid (the primary bone of the shoulder girdle in vertebrates other than mammals) is a",0,Enantiornithes is a group of extinct,Enantiornithes is a group of extinct,10,1.4b

Analogue broadcasting (PAL) was shut down on 3 April 2010.

Although satellite (DVB-S) broadcasting was initially considered, it was discarded due to the high cost of uploading the channel stream into satellites.

History

3/24 was born on 11 September 2003 as an initiative of the Catalan public television to develop digital terrestrial television in Catalonia. However, a general lack of DVB-T set top boxes combined with slight public interest towards digital terrestrial television prompted TVC to simulcast in analogue.

From its launch on 11 September 2003 until 12 June 2004, 3/24 was on air daily from 11 p.m. till 8:30 a.m.. The channel now operates as a regular full-time channel.

Contents
3/24 devotes exclusively to live news and information, including news, traffic (morning), sports and stock markets from Bolsa de Barcelona. Originally, 3/24 was to become the first 24-hour news service in Catalonia. Later, this plan was dropped, and it was remade into a continuous information service. In consequence, this channel now also features special blocks dedicated to science, society, history, etc.

Most of the day, under the title Notícies 3/24, the channel features a 30-minute informational wheel, including 2 minutes of headlines, 18 minutes of news, 8 minutes of sports and 2 minutes of regional weather. Along with other Televisió de Catalunya's channels, no live programming is featured between 01:00 and 07:00 unless news breaks.

3/24 also shares programs with sister channel TV3. It simulcasts TV3's daily news programs, Telenotícies every day at 14:30-16:00 and 21-22:00; and its morning news program Els Matins every weekday 08:00-10:15.

Dinghy racing takes place most weekends throughout the year and some evenings during the summer. Mostly dinghies raced are Enterprises and Lasers. In addition to sailing at Hammersmith, there are regular events against other dinghy clubs on the Thames and clubs further afield.

The yachting programme includes cruises (around the UK, cross-channel, in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean), training weekends, treasure hunts and races organised by the club. The club also participates in winter and spring series racing in the Solent, Cowes Week, Round the Island Race, Cork week, offshore JOG races, RORC races, the Fastnet race and some member-organised events.

The clubhouse is a Georgian building with river views and full facilities.

History

The club was established as the Corinthian Sailing Club in 1894, by a group of sailing enthusiasts who launched their boats from Bell Steps, beside the Black Lion pub, and close to the Hammersmith and Chiswick border. In the early years the members were all men and used to meet at each other's homes to discuss sailing matters and racing. It was then discovered that a new member owned a pub closer to the City and meetings were promptly convened there instead.

It is a generic method, independent of the language and source code analysis tools, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported license. Software editors can freely use and implement the SQALE method.

The SQALE method was developed by inspearit France (formerly DNV ITGS France). It is used by many organizations for applications of any type and any size. This method is implemented by several static code analysis tools that produce the defined indices and indicators. In addition, this method allows doing the precise management of design debt for Agile software development projects.

History 
The SQALE method has been developed to answer a general need for assessing the quality of source code. It is meant to answer fundamental questions such as:
 What is the quality of the source code delivered by the developers?
 Is the code changeable, maintainable, portable, reusable?
 What is the design debt stored up by the project?

Standards, like ISO 9126, do not provide effective support about the manner of building a global answer. To be able to evaluate the quality of source code, the developers community needs a generic method having the following properties:	
Objective, specific and reproducible
Producing indices, syntheses or/and indicators easily understandable and helping to make decisions relating to the improvement of the source code
Independent of the languages
Independent of the tools for analysis

Fundamental principles 
 The quality of the source code is a non-functional requirement.
The requirements in relation to the quality of the source code have to be formalised according to the same quality criteria as all other requirements.
Assessing the quality of a source code is in essence assessing the distance between its state and its expected quality objective.

She is best known for her 1936 mural, Recreation in Harlem at Harlem Hospital in New York City, which was restored and put on public display in 2012 after being hidden from view for many years.

Biography
Early life and education

Seabrooke was born in Charleston, South Carolina, the only child of George and Anna Seabrooke. Her family moved to New York City in 1920. George died when Georgette was a young child. Her mother was a domestic housekeeper, and Georgette worked with her while quite young, but she did well in school and graduated from Washington Irving High School. She also studied with James Lesesne Wells at the Harlem Art Workshop, and with Gwendolyn B. Bennett at the Harlem Community Art Center.

In 1933, at the age of 17, she was admitted to the prestigious Cooper Union School of Art in New York, where in 1935 she received the school's Silver Medal, its highest honor, for a painting entitled ""Church Scene."" Cooper Union denied Seabrooke her diploma in 1937 for what it said at the time was incomplete work, but six decades later, in 1997, it invited Seabrooke back to its campus to honor her achievements. In 2008 Cooper Union presented Seabrooke with a lifetime achievement award, and the school now considers her a member of its class of 1937.

 Recreation in Harlem and the WPA

While studying at Cooper Union, Seabrooke was chosen by the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) as one of four ""master artists"" to paint murals at Harlem Hospital. She was the youngest artist so chosen and the only female. The mural she painted, Recreation in Harlem, is nearly 20 feet long and depicts daily life in Harlem in the 1930s, including women chatting through a window and children performing in a choir.

There are eight diagram types that are intended to correspond with eight different fundamental thinking processes. They are supposed to provide a common visual language to information structure, often employed when students take notes.

Thinking Maps are visual tools for learning, and include eight visual patterns each linked to a specific cognitive process. Teachers may apply Thinking Maps in all content areas and all grade levels. The eight map types are:
 Circle Map used for defining in context
 Bubble Map used for describing with adjectives
 Flow Map used for sequencing and ordering events
 Brace Map used for identifying part/whole relationships
 Tree Map used for classifying or grouping
 Double Bubble Map used for comparing and contrasting
 Multi-flow map used for analyzing causes and effects
 Bridge map used for illustrating  analogies

By linking each thinking skill to a unique and dynamic visual representation, the language of Thinking Maps becomes a tool set for supporting effective instructional practice and improving student performance. Teachers and students, therefore, independently apply thinking skills for their own learning while also having a common visual language for cooperative learning. By having a rich language of visual maps based on thinking processes, learners are no longer confused by poorly organized brainstorming webs or an endless array of static graphic organizers. They are enabled to move from concrete to abstract concepts, think with depth, and directly apply their thinking to complex tasks.

General information 
Thinking Maps are a specific set of graphic Thinking organizers used in K-12 classroom settings, or ""visual teaching tools that foster and encourage life-long learning,"" as well as tol that provide students with the skills to be ""successful thinkers, problem solvers, [and] decision makers"" (Thinking Maps Inc., Pamphlet).

It was named after Tampa's nickname, ""The Big Guava"".

Since its inception more than 30 years ago, Guavaween became one of the largest festivals in Ybor. The daylight hours were family-oriented and in the past had included such activities as a costume contest, scavenger hunt, safe trick-or-treat at Centro Ybor, food and amusement rides. Around dusk the Mama Guava Stumble Parade, Guavaween's most popular attraction, made its way down Seventh Avenue, the main street in Ybor. The parade, led by Mama Guava, featured floats and costumed individuals who threw candy and beads to the spectators.

History

Historical roots

In the 1880s, Spanish-born and New York-based Gavino Gutierrez came to the area to search for wild guava trees that might be cultivated commercially. He didn't find usable trees, but he liked the small town of Tampa. After leaving the area, Gutierrez stopped by Key West to visit his friend, cigar manufacturer Vicente Martinez-Ybor. Ybor was looking for a place to relocate his prosperous business, and Gutierrez recommended Tampa. Ybor took his advice and eventually founded Ybor City, helping Tampa grow from a small village to a bustling city over the next few decades.

Referencing this local history in the 1970s, local newspaper columnist Steve Otto planted the idea that if New York City is the ""Big Apple"", then Tampa must be the ""Big Guava"". The nickname stuck.

Early Guavaween
According to a well known area artist and college professor of art, prior to Mama Guava and Guavaween, many (then) young artists were sharing loft spaces in an old closed cigar factory in the late 1970s and decided to throw a large Halloween party and charge all who attended $1.00. The party was a success and the artists continued the party in subsequent years and the crowds grew as word spread.

Páirc Uí Chaoimh, the home of the Cork GAA, is named after him.

Early life
Ó Caoimh was born in Roscommon in 1898.

He moved to Cork City at an early age; the 1911 census records him living at No. 13 East View Terrace on the Quaker Road. He lived with his father (an RIC Pensioner and Draper), his brother and his three sisters. One of these siblings, or some other relatives, would later live in Ballynoe, near Castlelyons, in County Cork.
 
He was educated by the Christian Brothers in Cork and was an active member of the Gaelic Athletic Association.

After leaving school he trained as a Secondary School teacher at Saint Mary's College in London, returning to Cork to teach at Presentation Brothers College.

In 1916, when he was 18, he joined the Irish Volunteers.

In 1919, at the age of 21, Ó Caoimh gave up school teaching to become a full-time Volunteer officer and secretary of the Cork County Board, G.A.A.

Irish War of Independence

During the Irish War of Independence, Ó Caoimh served with A Company (University Company), 2nd Battalion, Cork No. 1 Brigade, IRA.

His organisational talents impressed his superiors and in 1920 he was given another appointment as manager of the Employment Bureau (established by the First Dáil).

In November 1920, Ó Caoimh and about twenty other A Company Volunteers received orders to collect their weapons from the company arms dump and report to their headquarters in UCC From there the men were sent to a Fire Brigade storage shed on O'Sullivan's Quay to await further orders. After some hours word came that the British Forces they had been mobilised to ambush had moved and at 18:45 they were ordered to set off home.

Elisala was the son of Tui Manua Alalamua whose genealogy descended from the Sa Tagaloa.

Biography
Tui Manu'a Elisara was born on the island of Ta'u as the second son of Tui Manu'a Alalamua and Sofe, a daughter of Matiu of Ta'u island. Tui Manu'a Alalamua (of the female branch called the Avaloa clan in the Tui Manu'a family) was the successor of Tui Manu'a Tauveve, also from the Avaloa clan. Shortly after the death of Tui Manu'a Alalamua a vigorous debate ensued among potential heirs. 

From the three main branches of the Tui Manu'a family, three candidates emerged from each clan as each endorsed by their own branches of the Tui Manu'a family and their political allies: Alalamua's own son, Elisara (from the Avaloa clan) was named as an obvious contender although Elisara himself refused the title in lieu of his religious calling. The other two claimants were Taofi (from the female branch called the Falesoā clan of the Tui Manu'a family) and a young woman named Matelita (a descendant of Tui Manu'a Taliutafa Tupolo, son of Tui Manu'a Moaatoa of the Anoalo clan). 

With Elisara temporarily out of the succession, Taofi remained as one of the lesser direct heir and his party named him Tui Manu'a. Matelita's party, however, was able to amass even more support for her campaign (mainly through her male-side lineage of the Anoalo clan of the Tui Manu'a family and Eastern and Western Samoan relatives of her half-caste father Arthur Stephen ""Pa'u"" Young); Taofi capitulated to her sovereignty and she held the title until her death in 1895. As there were no other available family member of the male branch from the Anoalo clan after Tui Manu'a Matelita to take the title, in 1899 chiefly assembly of the Faletolu and Anoalo appointed the title to one of the female branches the Avaloa clan from Alalamua's line by persuadin",0,Tui Manua Elisala (died 2,Tui Manua Elisala (died 2,10,1.4b

Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC DOS, and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS, are sometimes referred to as ""DOS"" (which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system). MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s, from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system.

IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981, as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs. Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM, the two products diverged after twelve years, in 1993, with recognizable differences in compatibility, syntax, and capabilities.

During its lifetime, several competing products were released for the x86 platform, and MS-DOS went through eight versions, until development ceased in 2000. Initially, MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system, but application software and user data as well. Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats, along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures. Ultimately, it was the key product in Microsoft's development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm, providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI. It is a flexible operating system, and consumes negligible installation space.

The APG-77v1 was installed on F-22 Raptors from Lot 5 and on. This provided full air-to-ground functionality (high-resolution synthetic aperture radar mapping, ground moving target indication and track (GMTI/GMTT), automatic cueing and recognition, combat identification, and many other advanced features).

Jenko was born in Podreča in the Sora Plain (Sorško polje) in Upper Carniola, then part of the Austrian Empire, now in Slovenia, as an illegitimate son of poor peasant parents. Later he moved with his parents to Praše, which was the very inspiration for most of his poems and short stories. The local clergy enabled him to study in Novo Mesto, Klagenfurt, and Ljubljana. Contrary to their will, however, Jenko decided not to become a priest, but enrolled at the University of Vienna, where he studied law, classical philology, and history.

Together with Fran Levstik, Josip Jurčič, Josip Stritar, Simon Gregorčič, and Fran Erjavec, he belonged to the group of prominent Slovenes that embraced a progressive and nationalist political ideology (often with Pan-Slavic elements) and introduced literary realism in Slovenian literature. He mostly wrote lyrical and patriotic poems, which reveal an influence of late romanticism. He also wrote short prose in a realistic style.

He was the cousin of the composer Davorin Jenko. The two composed the song Naprej zastava slave together, which used to be the unofficial Slovenian national anthem up to the 1980s.

He died in Kranj.

The Jenko Award bestowed each year for the best poetry collection in Slovene published in the previous two years by the Slovene Writers' Association is named after Simon Jenko.

It aired on Fox in the United States on December 7, 2014.

Plot
Bob's father, Big Bob, is throwing his annual Christmas party at his restaurant, Big Bob's Diner. Linda urges them all to go, though Bob and his father do not get along. Bob institutes a ""15 Minute Rule"", which represents his father's ability to say something offensive enough to him within 15 minutes that Bob cannot stand to be around him and must leave. Since he was a child working in Big Bob's Diner, his father has not understood nor respected his son's desire to make creative burgers. As a boy, the first time he made one (called the ""Baby, You Can Chive My Car"" Burger) for his father's regular, Henry, Big Bob threw it away and made Henry ""the usual"", a  tuna melt, before Henry could have a taste.

At the party, Big Bob is cooking for his customers. The kids greet their grandfather, then head to his basement to build Bob a last minute Christmas present out of Big Bob's basement junk. Meanwhile, Linda and Bob meet Big Bob's regulars: Henry, Max, and Pete, who owns the gay bar, The Junk Yard, next door.

","The title Prince of Gothia (princeps Gothiæ) or Prince of the Goths (princeps Gothorum) was a title of nobility, sometimes assumed by its holder as a sign of supremacy in the region of Gothia and sometimes bestowed by the sovereign of West Francia to the principal nobleman in the south of the realm, in the ninth and tenth centuries. Sometimes hereditary and sometimes not, the title has been rendered in English as Duke (or Margrave) of Septimania (dux Septimaniæ) or Duke (or Margrave) of Gothia (Gothiæ marchio). A similar or the same ""office"" was often held with the title comes marcæ Hispanicæ: ""Count (or Margrave) of the Spanish March."" The title was also a chronicler's device and, as presented in some chronicles, may never have been used in any official capacity. 

The first employer of the title ""Duke of Septimania"" was William of Gellone, who acted as Charlemagne's chief official and missus in the region. He was succeeded by Berengar the Wise, who also used the ducal-margravial title. He in turn was succeeded by Bernard of Septimania, who is called comes marcæ Hispanicæ in the Annales Bertiniani. He ruled over both the County of Toulouse and that of Barcelona on the other side of the Pyrenees. Toulouse was the capital of Septimania, also called Gothia or later Languedoc, while Barcelona was capital of Catalonia. They had independent histories after the Moorish conquest of Iberia, but were both Visigothic in population. The Marca Hispanica corresponded to the Gothic lands on the other side of the Pyrenees to the east of the Navarre. The marca was evidently considered a political unity composed of several counties. In the civil wars in the region which followed Bernard's downfall and death in 844, the title went into abeyance. 

Sometime around 858, Charles the Bald granted Humfrid several Catalan counties and the title Gothiæ marchio, signifying the same supremacy over the Hispanic march that Bernard had held years earlier.

He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 16 February 2011. Ewing confirmed his departure in December 2013 and Heath made his on-screen exit on 29 July 2014, but made a brief appearance on 23 September 2014 for his brother Casey's (Lincoln Younes) funeral. Heath and Bianca made a return in 2016 and departed on 3 February 2017.

Creation and casting
In late 2010, Network Seven began running teaser trailers for a new trio of characters known as ""The River Boys"". Said to be a ""bad-boy surf gang with dodgy reputations"", The River Boys consist of three brothers – Heath, Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) and Casey (Lincoln Younes). Koby Abberton's Bra Boys were the inspiration for The River Boys. Heath made his on screen debut in February 2011.

Heath was the first of The River Boys to be announced, with Ewing's casting revealed on 24 September 2010. Heath is Ewing's second role with Home and Away, having appeared as Reuben Humphries in 2007. For his role, Ewing had to get fit and he joked ""I don't think they would cast overweight guys to play surfers, so yeah, I'm sure it was a factor for the producers."" He added that he cannot surf well and was relieved that the producers did not test his surfing skills at his audition. Initially, Ewing was employed as a member of the guest cast. He told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Heath was originally planned to be a part of the series for six months, but revealed that he had since joined the regular cast.

He collected some infantry, and a hundred and fifty horse, which from then on began to be part of Mapuche armies. Nangoniel returned to invest the Arauco fortress again, and with his cavalry it became so closely invested, that the Spaniards were unable to supply it and were forced to evacuate it. Following this success he moved against the fort of Santísima Trinidad which protected the passage of Spanish supplies via the Bio-bio River but clashed with a division of Spanish troops, under Francisco Hernández, where he lost an arm and had other dangerous wounds. He retreated to a neighbouring mountain, where he was ambushed by a Spanish force and slain with 50 of his soldiers. The same day Cadeguala was proclaimed Toqui by the Mapuche army.

Tashihchiao (modern Dashiqiao) is located about  southwest of the city of Haicheng, in present-day Liaoning Province, China. The town of Tashihchiao was of strategic importance in the Russo-Japanese War, as it was a railroad junction between the main line on the Russian South Manchurian Railway and a spur which led to the old treaty port of Yingkou (Newchwang). Control of both was essential for further advances by Japanese forces towards Liaoyang and Mukden.

Preparations by the Japanese

On the Japanese side were the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Divisions of the Japanese Second Army under General Oku Yasukata. The combined force had over 64,000 men, including 46,000 infantry, and 252 guns. After the victory at the Battle of Telissu, General Oku rested for four days for re-supply, which was delayed due to heavy rains, and to bring his 6th Division up to full strength. Although the Japanese were moving parallel to the railway line and the Russians had left behind over 300 freight cars at Dalny, the Japanese were unable to utilize the railway due to lack of locomotives. Locomotives procured by the Japanese matching the Russian railway gauge prior to the start of the war had been sunk by Russian commerce raiding in the Sea of Japan. The Japanese improvised by hauling the freight cars by teams of 16 men per car, and in addition hired 70 junks from the Chinese to move supplies up the coast to a point a couple of miles from the Japanese troop deployment.

By 6 July 1904, Oku was ready to move north again, and his four divisions reached the outskirts of Kaiping on 7 July 1904 and through night movements, were into the hills behind Kaiping by the morning of 9 July 1904 and was prepared for either combat or twenty additional days of marching.

In 2017, Czech President Miloš Zeman has appointed CEFC's founder Ye Jianming as his economic adviser.

In November 2017, the US Justice Department accused CEFC of offering a US$2 million bribe to the president of Chad for oil rights and, through its representatives, former Hong Kong Secretary for Home Affairs Patrick Ho and former Senegalese foreign minister Cheikh Gadio, depositing a US$500,000 bribe to an account designated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uganda. The energy fund denied authorising Ho to engage in corrupt practices. In December 2018, Ho was convicted in a US federal court on seven counts of bribery and money laundering, following a trial in which Gadio stood as a witness for prosecutors.

The campaign, which is led by parents and traces its origins to a thread on the on-line forum Mumsnet, is a spin-off of the Let Toys be Toys campaign, which seeks to get toy manufactures to stop gendering their products.

In its founding statement, the campaign said: “Children are listening, and take seriously the messages they receive from books, from toys, from marketing and the adults around them. Do we really want them to believe that certain things are off-limits for them because of their gender? They’re not ‘getting it wrong’ if a girl likes robots, or if a boy wants to doodle flowers. [...] It's time that publishers Let Books Be Books and leave children free to choose their interests for themselves”.

Response from authors
Prominent authors supporting the Let Books Be Books campaign include former and current children's laureates Anne Fine and Malorie Blackman, the poet laureate Carol-Ann Duffy, and Philip Pullman.

Anne Fine told UK newspaper The Guardian: ""You'd think this battle would have been won decades ago. But even some seemingly bright and observant adults are buying into it again […] There are girls of all sorts, with all interests, and boys of all sorts with all interests. Just meeting a few children should make that obvious enough. But no, these idiotic notions are spouted so often they become a self-fulfilling societal straitjacket from which all our children suffer"".

Also speaking to The Guardian, Pullman, author of the His Dark Materials trilogy, said: ""I'm against anything, from age-ranging to pinking and blueing, whose effect is to shut the door in the face of children who might enjoy coming in. No publisher should announce on the cover of any book the sort of readers the book would prefer. Let the readers decide for themselves"".
